[Supabase](https://supabase.com/) is an open-source Firebase alternative that provides a suite of backend services including a PostgreSQL database, authentication, real-time subscriptions, and storage.

MOHARA uses Supabase to build scalable and performant backend services, offering the flexibility of SQL with a modern API. Supabase's strong focus on open-source principles and its seamless integration with existing tools make it a powerful choice for developing mobile and web applications that require a reliable and customizable backend.

Due to the fact that Supabase includes a PostgreSQL database - it aligns with our desired stack. Supabase integrates natively with Flutterflow as well as JS based projects. So could provide the ideal infrastructure for Flutterflow projects transitioning into T3 projects.
