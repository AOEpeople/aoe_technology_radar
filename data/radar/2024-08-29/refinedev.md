[refine.dev](https://refine.dev/) is a flexible and extensible open-source framework for building internal tools, admin panels, dashboards, and more. It provides a set of pre-built components, hooks, and headless features, making it easy to create customizable admin portals with minimal configuration.

MOHARA is exploring the integration of refine.dev with T3 applications hosted on Vercel, connected to Supabase. This setup promises to deliver an efficient and open-source admin portal solution that is both easy to configure and integrate into our existing technology stack. The potential for seamless interaction with our T3 projects could streamline the development of powerful, user-friendly admin interfaces.
