[Angular](https://angular.io/), now in version 15, remains a robust and well-maintained front-end framework that continues to build new features on its solid foundation. Angular offers excellent tools for building large-scale applications.

For instance, it includes built-in capabilities for setting up and managing a monorepo, simplifying the sharing of components across multiple projects. As a framework, Angular takes an opinionated approach to solving various problems, reducing the need for extensive decision-making while maintaining consistency, yet still providing flexibility where necessary. Angular 15 further stabilizes standalone components, a feature introduced in Angular 14, with the aim of simplifying Angular applications and reducing module complexity, addressing a common criticism of Angular.

The ease of upgrading to new versions has improved significantly due to the framework's stability and the detailed migration guides provided by the maintainers.
