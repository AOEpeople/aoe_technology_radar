[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) is an open-source UI software framework used to build applications for Android, Android TV, iOS, macOS, tvOS, Web, Windows, and UWP. It enables developers to utilize the React framework alongside native platform features.

Developing applications with a single codebase can help ensure consistent user experiences across platforms, while also delivering the performance advantages of native code.
