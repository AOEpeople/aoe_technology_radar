TypeScript has become more widely used and is now considered the industry standard for most JavaScript projects and provides the means to prevent errors during development, refactor code, scale projects, and enhance code collaboration.

Its widespread adoption and the support of a large community contribute to further improving and documenting the language.

TypeScript is our language of choice for both existing and future projects, allowing us to write robust and clean JavaScript code.
