In the early days of [React](/languages-and-frameworks/react.html), [Flux](https://github.com/facebookarchive/flux) was introduced by Facebook as an architectural pattern for managing global state. Later, it evolved into a library, with contributions from the community.

Today, there are numerous libraries that offer the Flux pattern or similar approaches to state management. These include framework-agnostic solutions like [Redux](/languages-and-frameworks/redux.html) or [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/README.html), as well as framework-specific options like [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) for Vue and [Zustand](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand) for React, among many others.

One of the most popular solutions to date is Redux, which is why we use it in several projects.
