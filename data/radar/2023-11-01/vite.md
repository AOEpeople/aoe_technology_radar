As modern browsers now support the native usage of [ES Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules), it's possible to use them to enhance frontend development, which is the goal of [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html).

Since its announcement in 2020, Vite has garnered significant attention and has grown a large community that provides pluggable features. Vite offers two key components: a native ESM-based development server and a bundler for production builds.

The development server boasts improved performance during development, as modules are loaded and transpiled only on demand. This leads to faster cold-start times and quicker Hot Module Replacement (HMR) support.

We consider Vite to be a stable and production-ready tool, and we would recommend it for upcoming projects.
