We have decided to move Yarn into the "adopt" ring as it has continued to establish itself in recent years and has proven to be successful in many of our projects.

Yarn consistently offers better performance than npm and, in addition, provides both offline installation and the Plug'n'Play approach. With Plug'n'Play mode, Yarn replaces the node_modules directory with a virtual file system to enhance performance and save disk space.

Yarn is an excellent choice for monorepos, thanks to its support for workspaces, and is highly recommended as a package manager.
