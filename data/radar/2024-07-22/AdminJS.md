[AdminJS](https://adminjs.co/) is an open-source admin panel for applications, particularly effective in managing the content of web applications. It seamlessly integrates with your existing databases and backend frameworks, providing a robust interface for database operations without needing additional code. AdminJS supports a variety of ORM libraries like Sequelize, Mongoose, and TypeORM, and offers a customizable dashboard that can be tailored with custom components and actions.

MOHARA is trialing AdminJS as a potential solution for rapidly developing admin panels and content management systems. Its plug-and-play nature and ability to integrate directly with our databases significantly reduce development time and effort. Additionally, the customizable features allow for tailored solutions that meet specific internal needs, enhancing our productivity and streamlining our backend processes.
