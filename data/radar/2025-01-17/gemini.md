[Google Gemini](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/) is Google's latest multimodal AI model, designed to work with various types of information including text, code, audio, images, and video. It comes in three sizes - Ultra, Pro, and Nano - each optimized for different use cases and computational requirements.

MOHARA has placed Gemini in our hold ring while we evaluate its maturity and potential benefits. While the model shows promising capabilities, particularly in multimodal understanding and reasoning, we're waiting to see how it compares to our current AI tools in real-world applications. We're particularly interested in its code understanding capabilities and API stability, but are taking a measured approach before considering any integration into our workflow.
