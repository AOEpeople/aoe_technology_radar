[bolt.new](https://bolt.new) is an AI-powered design tool that can transform text descriptions into fully functional web applications. It goes beyond simple UI generation by creating complete, interactive web applications with working frontend and backend components, including database schemas and API endpoints.

MOHARA is assessing bolt.new's potential to accelerate our prototyping and MVP development process. While similar to v0 in UI generation, bolt.new's ability to create full-stack applications, including database structures and API endpoints, makes it an interesting tool for rapid application development. We're particularly interested in evaluating how its generated code aligns with our quality standards and how effectively it can be integrated into our development workflow. The tool's potential to quickly create working prototypes could be valuable for client demonstrations and proof of concept development.
