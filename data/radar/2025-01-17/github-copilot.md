[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) is an AI-powered code completion tool that helps developers write code faster and more efficiently. It uses OpenAI's Codex model to suggest code snippets, entire functions, and even complete files based on context and comments.

MOHARA has adopted GitHub Copilot as a key development tool, significantly enhancing developer productivity across various projects. The AI assistant helps with code generation, provides intelligent suggestions, and reduces repetitive coding tasks. Its integration with popular IDEs and understanding of multiple programming languages makes it an invaluable tool for our development teams.
