[Windsurf](https://www.codeium.com/windsurf) is an innovative AI-first IDE developed by Codeium that introduces the concept of "AI Flow" - a new paradigm in development environments. It features Cascade, a powerful agentic AI assistant that can understand complex development tasks and execute them autonomously while collaborating with developers.

MOHARA is evaluating Windsurf for its potential to revolutionize our development workflow. Its unique approach to AI assistance goes beyond traditional code completion, offering capabilities like autonomous task execution, intelligent project navigation, and deep understanding of codebases. We're particularly interested in how its agentic AI capabilities could enhance developer productivity and reduce the cognitive load in complex development tasks.
