[Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) is an AI-first code editor that combines the power of large language models with a modern development environment. Built on top of VSCode, it offers advanced AI features like chat-based code generation, intelligent code explanations, and automated refactoring capabilities.

MOHARA is currently assessing Cursor as a potential addition to our development toolkit. While it offers promising features like natural language code generation and integrated AI assistance, we are evaluating its reliability, performance, and how it complements our existing tools like GitHub Copilot. The ability to have conversational interactions with the codebase and its VSCode foundation make it an interesting candidate for enhancing our development workflow.
