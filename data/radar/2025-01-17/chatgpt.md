[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) is OpenAI's advanced language model that enables natural conversational interactions. It can assist with a wide range of tasks including writing, analysis, code explanation, problem-solving, and creative ideation. The model's ability to understand context and generate human-like responses makes it a versatile tool for various professional applications.

MOHARA is actively trialing ChatGPT across different aspects of our workflow. Our teams use it for initial code reviews, documentation drafting, problem-solving sessions, and brainstorming. While we maintain human oversight and validation, ChatGPT has shown promise in accelerating various tasks and providing valuable insights. We're particularly exploring its integration with our development and product management processes through the GPT-4 API, while being mindful of data security and accuracy verification.
