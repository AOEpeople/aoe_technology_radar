[TM Forum Open Digital Architecture (ODA)](https://www.tmforum.org/oda/) provides architectural blueprints for
communication service providers (CSPs), based on modern patterns and technologies such as microservices or
cloud-native solutions. It offers a number of benefits, including:

- open, standards-based reference architecture for software development in the telco domain
- faster time-to-market through a modular and flexible architecture
- simplified management and updates to reduce cost and the risk of downtimes
- enhanced customer experience by delivering personalized, high-quality services

As a [TM Forum member](https://www.tmforum.org/membership/current-members/), DCX has signed [both the Open API and
the ODA Manifesto](https://www.tmforum.org/oda-interactive-map/open-digital-architecture-open-api-manifesto/) and is
strongly committed to the values and visions behind these open standards.
