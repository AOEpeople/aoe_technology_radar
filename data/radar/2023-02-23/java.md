[Java](https://www.java.com) is a versatile and widely-used programming language.

It is scalable and platform-independent, making it the ideal choice for businesses looking to streamline their
operations and reach a wider audience. With its broad library of tools, frameworks and modules, Java provides developers
with the resources they need to create dynamic, feature-rich applications that can be easily integrated into existing
systems. Additionally, Java has a large community of developers, ensuring that support and resources are available when
needed.

With an extensive expertise at AOE we successfully run lots of Java projects in production. As it is very stable, has
great support from the open source community and lots of other big advantages, we often we use
[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) combined with the strengths of java to develop web services that
fits the needs of our customers.
