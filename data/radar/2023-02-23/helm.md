At DCX, we have adopted [Helmfile](https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile) as a complementary tool to Helm. It is
a declarative spec for deploying helm charts providing additional functionality such as:

- Separation between environment specific and general values
- Simplified secrets management with support for external applications, e.g. Vault
- Remote state storage in e.g. S3, similar to Terraform

Overall, Helmfile makes it a lot easier to manage and maintain multiple Helm charts and releases.
