[Hot Chocolate](https://chillicream.com/docs/hotchocolate/v12) is an open-source GraphQL server for .NET.
It is compatible to many GraphQL clients and tools and is really easy to set up and use. We assess it in one of our
projects as an alternative to [GraphQL .NET](https://graphql-dotnet.github.io/docs/getting-started/introduction/).
