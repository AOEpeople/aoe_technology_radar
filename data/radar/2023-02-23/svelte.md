[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) is neither a language nor a framework, but actually a compiler. It compiles HTML templates
to specialized code that manipulates the DOM directly, which may reduce the size of transferred files and give better
client performance.

It is surprisingly easy to work with, and we currently assess it in an internal project.
