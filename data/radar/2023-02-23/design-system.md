A Design System is a collection of reusable design components, guidelines and standards that serve as the foundation for
creating a consistent user experience across a product or a whole brand.

It helps to create a unified visual language, improve collaboration among design and development teams, and streamline
the design and development process.

Design Systems also increase the maintainability of the design of products, making it easier for teams to make updates
and add new features over time.

We are in the process to implement a design system in close cooperation with one of our customers.

Tools we use for this are [zeroheight](https://zeroheight.com/) as a documentation hub,
[Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary) for the token generation,
[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to document the components and [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for the Designs.
