[Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) is a build system for JavaScript and TypeScript project,
which uses a [Monorepo](https://www.DCX.com/techradar/methods-and-patterns/monorepo.html) structure for their codebase.

It helps to build projects efficiently by clever caching and resolving dependencies.
At the same time, Turborepo is very easy and fast to use and doesn't get in the way.
