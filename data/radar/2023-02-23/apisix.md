[Apache APISIX](https://apisix.apache.org/) is an open-source, high-performance API gateway, designed for
microservices, cloud-native and container-based architecture. It provides a wide range of features to manage
and secure API services:

- Scalability: Load balancing and routing, dynamic scaling
- Performance: Fast and reliable, supports caching and rate limiting
- Multi-Protocol Support: Supports HTTP, HTTPS, WebSockets and gRPC
- Customization: Plugins for authentication, authorization and traffic management

At AOE, we are currently assessing Apache APISIX in one of our cloud infrastructure projects.
