[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) is a tool used to describe infrastructure and applications and their configuration
as code. It covers both the configuration and provisioning aspects of infrastructure and applications.

It is a radically simple IT automation system based on SSH so that it can work without agents or exposed APIs. It
handles configuration management, application deployment, cloud provisioning, ad-hoc task execution, network automation,
and multi-node orchestration.

It comes in handy when the client currently uses some virtual machines with docker/docker-compose, and no full-blown
Kubernetes cluster is available or needed.
