As writing frontend applications becomes more complex, [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) allows us to scale client side code easily, even with large code bases.
We use Typescript successfully at production for many projects and we are only going to use it even more in the future.
We highly recommend using Typescript over JavaScript, therefore we have decided to move it to adopt.
