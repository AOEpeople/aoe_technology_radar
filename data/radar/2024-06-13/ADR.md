[ADR](https://adr.github.io/) is a justified design choice that addresses a functional or non-functional requirement that is architecturally significant. It allows for changes to architecture to be tracked over time to better tell the story of how a codebase changed over time.

MOHARA uses ADRs to ensure that each codebase contains a timeline of the reasoning and considerations for each of its changes.
