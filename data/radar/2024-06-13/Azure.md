[Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) is a cloud computing service created by Microsoft for building, testing, deploying, and managing applications and services through Microsoft-managed data centers.

MOHARA has a few projects hosted on Azure, yet our preference is leaning towards AWS due to flexibility and internal experience.
