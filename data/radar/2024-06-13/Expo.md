[Expo](https://expo.dev/) is an open-source platform for making universal native apps for Android, iOS, and the web with JavaScript and React.

MOHARA uses Expo to develop cross-platform mobile applications efficiently. Its tools and services streamline the development process and reduce the complexity of building native apps. Over the air updates provide a great experience for releasing non-breaking changes to Native applications.

Expo is part of the [T3 Turbo](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo) stack - and is being assessed.
