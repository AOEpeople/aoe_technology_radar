[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries by using a type system you define for your data.

MOHARA uses GraphQL to build flexible and efficient APIs. Its ability to fetch exactly the data needed by clients reduces over-fetching and improves performance. There are certain use cases where GraphQL provide the flexibility required by larger applications - yet tRPC is proving more valuable in those areas as of late.
