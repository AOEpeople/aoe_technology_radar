[C4 Models](https://c4model.com/) are a set of software architecture diagrams created by Simon Brown. They consist of a hierarchical set of diagrams for context, containers, components, and code.

MOHARA uses C4 Models to visualize software architecture, improving understanding and communication among stakeholders. It forms a key part of the Technical Solution Design sprints that we run when starting a new project.
