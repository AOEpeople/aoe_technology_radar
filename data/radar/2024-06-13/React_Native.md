[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) is a framework for building native apps using React. It allows developers to use the same codebase for building applications for both iOS and Android platforms.

MOHARA uses React Native to develop cross-platform mobile applications efficiently. It provides a consistent development experience and reduces the time and resources needed to build and maintain mobile apps.

It also allows for developers competent in React to begin developing native applications.
