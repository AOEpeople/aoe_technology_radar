The [T3 stack](https://create.t3.gg/) is a fullstack framework based on Next.js. It leverages Typescript, tRPC, Prisma, and Tailwind CSS to provide a type-safe development experience from the frontend to the database.

MOHARA trials the T3 stack for its fullstack capabilities, which allow fewer developers to work across the entire codebase efficiently. The stack's large ecosystem and prescriptive structure enable rapid development and easy implementation of commonly requested features.
