[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a tool that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

Docker is used on a case by case basis - but due to the rise of serverless frameworks and PaaS, Docker is only really used for legacy applications (due to the fact that Serverless offerings most likely use Docker under the hood).
