[Flutterflow](https://flutterflow.io/) is a low-code platform for building native mobile applications. It allows developers to design, build, and deploy applications quickly using a visual interface, while still providing the flexibility to write custom code when needed. With Flutterflow, developers can leverage the power of Flutter to create beautiful, responsive UIs without needing to write extensive amounts of code.

MOHARA uses Flutterflow to accelerate the development of mobile applications, particularly for projects that benefit from a rapid prototyping approach. Its seamless integration with Firebase and support for custom functions make it a powerful tool for creating scalable and maintainable apps that can evolve with the needs of the business.
