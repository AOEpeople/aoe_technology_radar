[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) is a core technology of the web, enabling interactive and dynamic content on websites. It is supported by all modern web browsers and has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.

MOHARA uses JavaScript primarily for frontend development to create engaging and responsive user experiences. Its flexibility allows for seamless integration with various backend technologies and frameworks. MOHARA favours Typescript rather than using primitive Javascript.
