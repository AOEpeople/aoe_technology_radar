[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) is an open-source UI software development toolkit created by Google. It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, and the web from a single codebase.

Flutterflow is commonly used in NoCode builds - and Flutter is the language powering these projects. Therefore Flutter could be used when more customization is required in a NoCode project.
