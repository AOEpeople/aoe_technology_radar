[Amazon Textract](https://aws.amazon.com/textract/) is a machine learning service that automatically extracts text, handwriting, layout elements, and data from scanned documents. It goes beyond simple optical character recognition (OCR) to identify, understand, and extract structured data from forms and tables. The service provides advanced capabilities including form extraction, table detection, and layout analysis with high accuracy and confidence scores for extracted data.

**Key Capabilities:**

- Optical character recognition for printed text and handwriting
- Form and table data extraction with structure preservation
- Layout analysis for paragraphs, titles, lists, headers, and footers
- Query-based extraction using natural language questions
- Custom queries for business-specific document types
- Signature detection and verification
- Support for invoices, receipts, and identity documents

MOHARA has adopted Amazon Textract as a document processing service for extracting structured and unstructured data from documents, particularly for projects already leveraging AWS infrastructure where it provides seamless integration with other AWS services.
