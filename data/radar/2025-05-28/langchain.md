[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) is a popular framework for developing applications powered by language models. It provides a standard interface for chaining together LLMs with other tools and data sources, making it easier to build complex AI applications.

**Key Capabilities:**

- Modular components for building LLM applications
- Built-in integrations with popular LLM providers and tools
- Document loading, splitting, and vectorization utilities
- Structured output parsing and validation
- Memory systems for maintaining conversation context
- Agent frameworks for autonomous task execution
- Streaming support for real-time responses
- Extensive templating and prompt management
