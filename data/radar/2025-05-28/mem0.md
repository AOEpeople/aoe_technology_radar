[Mem0](https://mem0.ai/) (pronounced "mem-zero") is a self-improving memory layer for LLM applications that enhances AI assistants with persistent, contextual memory. It combines LLMs with vector-based storage to help AI systems learn from and adapt to user interactions over time, enabling more personalized and efficient AI experiences.

**Key Capabilities:**

- Memory Processing: Automatic extraction and storage of important information from conversations
- Dual Storage Architecture: Combined vector and graph databases for efficient memory storage and relationship tracking
- Smart Retrieval System: Semantic search and graph queries based on importance and recency
- Memory Management: Continuous updates and contradiction resolution
- Cost Optimization: Up to 80% reduction in LLM costs through intelligent data filtering
- Multi-Modal Support: Handles text, images, audio, and video data
- Simple API Integration: Easy-to-use endpoints for adding and retrieving memories

**[Documentation](https://docs.mem0.ai/)**

MOHARA should evaluate Mem0 for projects requiring persistent context in AI applications, particularly for use in Agentic applications or any application where maintaining conversation history and user preferences is crucial for providing personalized experiences.
