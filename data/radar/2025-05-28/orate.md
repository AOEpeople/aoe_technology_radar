[Orate](https://www.orate.dev/) is an AI toolkit for speech that provides a unified API for text-to-speech and speech-to-text capabilities. It enables developers to work with multiple leading AI providers like OpenAI, ElevenLabs, AssemblyAI, and Azure through a single, consistent interface.

**Key Capabilities:**

- Text-to-Speech (TTS): Generate realistic, human-like speech
- Speech-to-Text (STT): Accurate audio transcription
- Voice Style Transfer: Change voice styles while preserving content
- Speech Isolation: Extract clean speech from audio
- Multi-provider Support: Integration with ElevenLabs, AssemblyAI, Azure, and LMNT
- Unified API: Consistent interface across different providers
- NPM Package: Easy integration with JavaScript/TypeScript projects
- Plug-and-play Architecture: Simple provider switching

**[Documentation](https://www.orate.dev/docs)**

MOHARA should evaluate Orate for projects requiring high-quality speech synthesis or transcription capabilities, particularly when flexibility across different AI providers is needed.
