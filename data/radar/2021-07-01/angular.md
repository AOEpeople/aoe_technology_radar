Actually in version 11 Angular has become an adult SPA framework with much faster build time and significant smaller production builds.
Updating to newer versions has become mostly a "no-brainer" which helps us to integrate the latest community bug-fix & improvements on a friday during a cup of coffee.
Angular ships as a fully integrated development platform from scaffolding, code generation, routing, guarding, unit/e2e-testing, multi-language builds (i18n) and stable dev/build processes and keeping it extensible at the same time.
This holistic nature of Angular makes it in the beginning way more difficult to learn but once understood it's a great candidate to go very fast into "requirement implementation" aka providing early value rather than library wiring.
Beside the existing telco-industry projects we've actually also chosen Angular for resource critical industry 4.0 / embedded projects.
Here we've selected Angular beside the performance aspects to fulfill requirements like adaptive multi device support (custom hardware buttons, tablets and laptops) on the one hand and on the other hand to reduce the risk loosing time by having too many self-managed external dependencies.
