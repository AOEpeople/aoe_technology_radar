[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a young and modern programming language initially developed by [Mozilla Research](https://research.mozilla.org/).

It provides a strict type system, compile-time memory-safety, excellent [package manager](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/), object-oriented & functional programming, task-based concurrency, good readability and maintainability and many more.
It has a C/C++ [comparable efficiency](https://greenlab.di.uminho.pt/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sleFinal.pdf) and helps the programmer to avoid unnecessary security-relevant memory-related bugs during compile-time.
Since every memory-allocation is directly released after it can't be used anymore ([owner deletion](https://medium.com/@rabin_gaire/memory-management-rust-cf65c8465570)), no garbage collection is needed.

C/C++ code/libraries can be integrated by its [binding generator tool](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen).

At stackoverflow it is votes 5 years in a row ([2016](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2016#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted), [2017](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#technology-_-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages), [2018](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018#technology-_-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages), [2019](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages), [2020](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages-loved)) for the `most loved programming-language` by programmers.
The [popularity](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages-loved) is growing continuous.

With it's memory-safety/efficiency and energy-efficiency it helps to save money for bug-fixing, energy and cloud-computing.
