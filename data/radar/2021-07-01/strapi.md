Strapi is a headless CMS built with Javascript on Node.js.
Its data-centered approach offers great flexibility for many use cases by integrating with the available APIs.

Strapi's API comes in a RESTful and [GraphQL](/methods-and-patterns/graphql.html) variant.
Both perfectly support the [API-first design approach](/methods-and-patterns/api-first-design-approach.html).

Ever since the stable release version 3.0.0 from mid-2020, the CMS reached market maturity and offers a good choice for scalable headless CMSs.
As of the 3.6 release in April 2021, Strapi features [full internationalization support](https://strapi.io/blog/announcing-content-internationalization-v3-6), making it a viable candidate to be evaluated toe to toe with solutions like Drupal.

At AOE we are evaluating Strapi for various projects, appreciating its straightforward installation, setup, and use by editors in lieu of more heavy-weight solutions used in the past.
