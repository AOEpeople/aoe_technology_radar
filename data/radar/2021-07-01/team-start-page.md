A team start page helps (new) members to orientate themselves.
It normally displays all team members with their roles and contact data as well as a collection of links to the necessary tools, e.g.

- Project environments (staging, prod, ...)
- Project development setup
- Version control system
- Code Review Tool
- Team rules
- Slack invitation
- ...

Simply things, everyone should know.

At DCX we care to have a team start page for each team in our wiki.
