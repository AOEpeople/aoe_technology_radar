Web Performance Monitoring is the process of measuring a Web serviceâ€™s ability to respond efficiently to user interactions.
Data gathered through monitoring helps analyze performance bottlenecks, plan improvements, and measure a site's responsiveness.

[Sitespeed.io](https://www.sitespeed.io/) is a set of Open Source tools that makes it easy to monitor and measure the performance of a website.
It tests websites using real (or headless) browsers, simulating users connectivity and collecting important user-centric metrics.
The tools are packaged as a docker image that can be easily deployed.
Data collected can be saved to different locations for later analysis which makes it easy to track changes.
Last, Sitespeed.io can be used as part of a continuous integration pipeline or as part of a monitoring solution.
