We continue to use Akeneo with a variety of customers to store and process product data in a standardized format. It is the de facto standard for open source PIM's and therefore an integral part of our e-commerce solutions.

In the meantime, Akeneo has been continuously developed and offers many new features that further facilitate product data collection.

The recent switch to Elasticsearch and an update of Symfony improved runtime behaviour as well as scalability for future-prove use. Support for the latest release of PHP 8 is upcoming.
