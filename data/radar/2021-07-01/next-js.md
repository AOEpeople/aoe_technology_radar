[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) claims itself as **the** React framework for production.
It comes with first-class developer experience and many features for example: hybrid static & server-side rendering, TypeScript support, image optimization, code splitting & much more.

We at AOE are already using Next.js for some big projects.
The main reason for that is the modern stack (React with TypeScript) and the possibility to render on the server (static pre-rendering or dynamic SSR) to be able to get crawled by search engines and stay SEO relevant.
