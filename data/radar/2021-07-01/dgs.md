The [DGS Framework](https://netflix.github.io/dgs/) is a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) server framework based on [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot/).
It extends [GraphQL Java](https://www.graphql-java.com/) with additional features such as:

- an annotation-based programming model for Spring
- a test framework for writing query tests as unit tests
- a [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) code generation plugin to create types from a GraphQL schema

It works well with both Java and Kotlin and allowed us a quick start with getting our first GraphQL servers up and running.
