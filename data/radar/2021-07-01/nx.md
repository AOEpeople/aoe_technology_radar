[Nx](https://nx.dev/) is a suite of powerful, extensible dev tools to help you architect, test, and build at any scale.
It is mainly applicable in the environment of React, Angular and Node.js and tries to simplify and streamline the work in a mono repo.

At DCX, we are currently taking our first steps with NX in a mono repo that is home to both our React and Next.js based frontend and our [Go](/languages-and-frameworks/go-lang.html) / [Flamingo](/languages-and-frameworks/flamingo.html) based backend.

The integration with the Node.js components (React, Next.js, Cypress) works smoothly and brings the expected benefits such as faster build times through intelligent caching.
Support for Go is currently only rudimentary, which is why NX still has to prove itself in this area.

Especially in the environment of Node.js in combination with the use of a mono repo, NX is worth a look.
