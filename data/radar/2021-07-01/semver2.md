[Semantic Versioning 2.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) is a scheme for specifying a software's version.
As the de facto standard, this is widely used and established in all areas of software development.
It offers a clear way of communicating changes over the lifetime of the software being developed.

Especially in large-scale projects with many components being dependent on each other, it is important to use unambiguous communication across teams.
