Cypress has proven itself in AOE projects.
With its support for JavaScript and TypeScript, Cypress is a testing tool that strongly relates to front-end developers.
It is very easy to adopt, and the test specifications are easy to implement and to maintain.
Test execution is very fast, and the results are well documented, understandable and easy to publish, e.g. via GitLab Pages.
It currently supports Chrome, Firefox and Electron.
