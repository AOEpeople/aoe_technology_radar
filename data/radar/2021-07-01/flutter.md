[Flutter](https://flutter.io) allows writing native applications for different platforms with a single code base in [Dart](https://dart.dev).

It provides stable platform implementations for both major mobile platforms iOS and Android.
With [Flutter on the Web](https://flutter.dev/web) it is possible to build single-page applications (SPA) out of the same code with full support for service workers.
The [Desktop](https://flutter.dev/desktop) (Windows, Mac, Linux) platform is currently still in beta (as of mid 2021).

The compilation into native platform code prevents from bottleneck-issues due context switching and runtime bridging, which can be found in other cross-platform frameworks like [React Native](https://reactnative.dev).

Comparing to a Javascript-based PWA, Flutter's approach promises a better performance and energy-efficiency.

We gathered first positive experience with small applications, which used the Alpha and Beta state of Flutter for Linux (x64) and Web by the time of development.
