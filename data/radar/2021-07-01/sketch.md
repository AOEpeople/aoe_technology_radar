Figma is a vector graphics editor and primarily web-based prototyping tool, with additional offline features enabled by desktop applications for macOS and Windows. The Figma Mirror companion apps for Android and iOS allow viewing Figma prototypes on mobile devices. The next step in our toolchain development comes right after the Sketch+Abstract approach. Figma enabled the next level of collaboration between designers, stakeholders, and frontend engineers.
