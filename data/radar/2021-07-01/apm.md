Application performance management (APM) enables to predict and prevent performance issues before they impact your users or your business.
APM solutions help organizations to ensure that applications meet performance, availability and user experience expectations.
This can be achieved by measuring application performance, providing visibility into performance issues, alerting developers and administrators when performance problems appear, and allow analysing how reliable an improvement is compared to a previous state.
In the last years APM solutions are evolving from application performance monitoring tools to more feature full systems that incorporating observability, performance data collection and analysis, which is more to date with distributed cloud-native applications.

Our experience with APM relates to the instrumentation of applications. This includes exposing metrics, tracing and integration with external services such as [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/). We decided to go for this approach given the simplicity and the benefits they proved on a daily basis when analyzing and optimizing our software.
