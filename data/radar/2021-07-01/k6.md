Load Testing is a testing process in which the performance of a software application or system is tested under a specific expected load.
It determines how the system behaves while being accessed by multiple users simultaneously.
The goals of Load Testing is to improve performance bottlenecks and to ensure stability under high traffic.
When done regularly, it provides confidence in the system, its reliability and performance, helps identify the bottlenecks in the system under heavy user stress scenarios before they happen in a production environment, and gives protection against poor user experience when using the system.

[K6](https://k6.io/) is a developer-centric, free and open-source load testing tool.
The command line runner executes scripts written in JavaScript and allows to configure the execution time and the number of virtual users.
The tool can be used for load testing and performance testing.
However, it can not be used to run tests that rely only on the browser, making it more suitable for testing of APIs.
