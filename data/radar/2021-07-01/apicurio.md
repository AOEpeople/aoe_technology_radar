[Apicurio Studio](https://www.apicur.io/studio/) is a browser-based, open-source API design studio. It can be used to create or modify APIs using the [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/specification/). The visual editor supports collaborative development and allows to easily define example responses matching incoming requests.

At AOE, we use Apicurio Studio in conjunction with [Microcks](https://microcks.io/) as part of our API-first development approach. While specifying an API, a corresponding mock server can be set up with a single mouse click. The frontend and backend parts of an application can then be developed independently by using the mock server and the API specification generated by Apicurio Studio.
