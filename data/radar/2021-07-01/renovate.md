[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/) is an automated dependency update tool.
It vastly reduces the time and effort spent on keeping a project's dependencies up-to-date by automatically creating merge requests whenever a dependency needs to be updated.
The tool is easy to set up and configure, offers built-in support for monorepo architectures and works with various programming languages and package managers, e.g.

- JavaScript & Yarn
- Java & Gradle
- PHP & Composer

At DCX, we use the [Renovate CLI tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/renovate/) in the CI pipelines of a constantly growing number of projects.
