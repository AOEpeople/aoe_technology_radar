Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool. It allows users to define and provision infrastructure using a high-level configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), or optionally JSON. Terraform can manage both cloud and on-premises resources, making it a versatile tool for deploying and managing infrastructure across a wide range of service providers.
