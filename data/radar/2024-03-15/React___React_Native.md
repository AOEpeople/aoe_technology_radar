<p>There are several reasons why a BioLizard has settled on React or React Native as the default frontend framework:</p> <ul> <li>Reusability: React components are highly reusable, which makes it easier to build and maintain complex user interfaces. This can save time and resources in the long run.</li> <li>Strong ecosystem: React has a large and active community, with many third-party libraries and tools available to help developers build and maintain applications.</li> <li>Cross-platform compatibility: React Native allows developers to build mobile apps for both iOS and Android using the same codebase, which can be a major advantage for companies looking to develop apps for both platforms.</li> <li>Scalability: React is highly scalable and can be used to build applications of any size or complexity, making it a good choice for companies that anticipate rapid growth.</li> </ul>
