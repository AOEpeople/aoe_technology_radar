[Unleash](https://www.getunleash.io/) is a feature (toggle / flag) management service written in Node.js.
You can enable/disable features independent of deployment schedules. For larger projects with many feature flags
you can benefit from usage statistics and metrics which are collected for each flag.

<!--except-->

A lot of activation strategies are provided by Unleash out of the box, like Boolean On/Off, Gradual Rollout,
IPs, and so on, while allowing you to add custom strategies.

To evaluate the feature flag you can choose one of the [official SDKs](https://docs.getunleash.io/sdks#official-sdks)
or use the [REST-API](https://docs.getunleash.io/api) directly.
