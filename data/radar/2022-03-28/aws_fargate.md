It doesn't always have to be Kubernetes. For projects with a small number of applications launching and managing a Kubernetes cluster might be just too much. AWS Fargate is a nice alternative for running your containerized applications. Everything can be provisioned via Terraform and AWS Fargate, which allows you not having to deal with clusters or nodes abstracting everything away from you.
