[Bare.ID](https://bare.id) is our solution to the problem of operating and maintaining a [Keycloak](https://keycloak.org) cluster: a SaaS offering for a managed Keycloak cluster.
By providing additional features such as an easy-to-use-management console, multiple authentication factors and a gallery of one-click integrations for well-known applications, Bare.ID brings additional value and takes off operating a redundant Keycloak cluster by yourself.
All hosting and operations happens in Germany and Europe to ensure the highest data privacy and security requirements.
