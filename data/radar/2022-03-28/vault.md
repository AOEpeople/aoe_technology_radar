Secure handling of access tokens is key to provide secure applications and environments.
In a completely automated world, with tools doing everything from building, testing to deploying and operating, it is crucial to control who gets access to what resources.
Vault enables us to securely issue tokens for deployment jobs, manage certificates and handle credentials in a secure and controlled manner.
We change Vault to "adopt".
