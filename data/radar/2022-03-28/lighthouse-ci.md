At DCX, we want to keep a permanent eye on the metrics of the [Web Vitals](https://web.dev/learn-web-vitals/) for our projects.

[Lighthouse CI](https://web.dev/lighthouse-ci/) is a collection of free tools that facilitate the use of Lighthouse for performance monitoring. With Lighthouse CI we get a history of evaluation results and can compare them over time. It is also possible to set performance budgets to ensure that a website's performance does not deteriorate through regression.

Although performance monitoring is the most common use case for Lighthouse CI, other aspects of Lighthouse can also be monitored, such as SEO or accessibility. Thus, the use of Lighthouse CI can help ensure an overall good user experience.
