[spockframework.org](http://www.spockframework.org) - Spock is a testing and specification framework for Java and Groovy
applications.

For the most parts we switched from Groovy to Java or Kotlin with JUnit 5. In this regard we think that the active
community and regular updates and extension libraries of JUnit 5 cover everything we want or need.

[gebish.org](http://www.gebish.org) - Geb is a browser automation solution.

UI testing with Geb is replaced by Cypress or Playwright.
