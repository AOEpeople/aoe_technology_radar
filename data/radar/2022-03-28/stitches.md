Stitches is a lightweight & performant CSS-in-JS styling library with a focus on component architecture and developer
experience.

Unlike most CSS-in-JS libraries, Stitches promises near-zero runtime costs. This is possible by avoiding unnecessary
prop interpolations and defining variants upfront.

Stitches has a fully typed API to provide an awesome developer experience. It comes with built-in theme support,
server-side rendering & much more.

At DCX we use Stitches when we want to write performant and scalable CSS, but don't want to give up the flexibility and
developer experience of React components.
