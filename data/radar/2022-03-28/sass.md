Since the heydays of Sass, the requirements for styling solutions have changed.

With modern solutions like [CSS-in-JS](/methods-and-patterns/css-in-js.html),
[Tailwind](/languages-and-frameworks/tailwindcss.html) or [PostCSS](/tools/postcss.html), you get scoped CSS out of the
box and can get rid of the manual and therefore error-prone BEM methodology. Furthermore, mapping class names to
elements is no longer necessary.

In general the modern solutions bring a better and more robust developer experience. Therefore, we put Sass on hold.
