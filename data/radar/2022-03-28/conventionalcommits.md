Conventional commits are being widely used in our teams, therefore we're changing this to adopt. Using commit messages
which follow the [conventional commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) helps us to easily
process changes made within a software release. It also helps to reduce confusion around commit message requirements for
new team members.

The [Semanticore](https://github.com/AOEpeople/semanticore) release bot is a tool we published, which utilizes
conventional commits to maintain the release notes of our software and suggests the correct version of the upcoming
release.
