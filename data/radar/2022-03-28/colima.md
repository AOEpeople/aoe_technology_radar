[Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) provides container runtimes on macOS with minimal setup.

At AOE, we are using Colima as drop-in replacement
for [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

The main benefits are

- Support of M1 Macs
- Simple CLI interface

as well as the usual requirements for container runtimes like

- Docker and Containerd support
- Port forwarding
- Volume mount
- Kubernetes
