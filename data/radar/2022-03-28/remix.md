Remix is a full stack web framework that lets us focus on the user interface and work with web standards.

One of Remix biggest features is the availability of nested routes. Through nested routes, Remix can eliminate nearly
every loading state.

Most web apps fetch inside of components, creating request waterfalls which leads to slower page loads. Remix loads data
in parallel on the server and sends a fully formed HTML document

At DCX we use Remix for our enterprise web applications to provide a first class UX and fast page loads.
