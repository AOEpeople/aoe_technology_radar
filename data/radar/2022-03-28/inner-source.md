Inner Source is a strategy to frictionless cross-team collaboration in software development inside an organization.
Based on Open Source methodologies, it provides an adaptable set of tools and practices for contributing to code
developed by other teams. By fostering transparency and openness, it lowers the hurdle to get involved into
decision-making throughout the corporation.

Core principles of Inner Source include:

- openness: all artifacts developed by an organization should be available to all employees
- active contribution: developers are encouraged to rather implement a feature instead of asking for it
- written communication: all decisions should be comprehensible and transparent
- rewards and motivation: every contribution is important and deserves recognition

As DCX strives for a high involvement of every employee into decision processes and organizational development, Inner
Source seems an ideal fit to our [company culture](https://www.DCX.com/en/career/how-we-work.html).
