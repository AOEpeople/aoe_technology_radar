We see a lot of clustering in teams, microservices, libraries, and so on. We think a centralized software catalog
like [Backstage](https://backstage.io/) can help use to get a clearer view of our stack and the dependencies of a
platform.
It also helps to get the information and documentation you need as a developer more quickly.

Backstage is an open-source developer portal platform created by Spotify. There is a very active community around it
with already a lot of plugins for integrations with other tools, ci, monitoring and so on.

At DCX we assess backstage in a big project with a subset of features.
