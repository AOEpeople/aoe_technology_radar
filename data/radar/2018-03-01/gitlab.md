[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) provides nearly the same feature set as [GitHub](https://github.com/), but at a lower price. It also provides the possibility of hosting internally, which is essential for us.

We are migrating more and more repositories from [gitolite](http://gitolite.com/gitolite/index.html), even from SVN to GitLab, as it provides a more stable and user-friendly interface.

GitLab also makes user/permission handling easier than our old gitolite. We don't need the IT team every time a new repository needs to be set up.
