Cohere offers a variety of [Command](https://cohere.com/command) models that cover many different use cases—well suited to text generation, translation, and chat applications.

[Cohere-Embeddings](https://cohere.com/embed) and [Re-ranking](https://cohere.com/rerank) Models offer high-performance tools for building semantic search, recommendation systems, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines. Cohere’s multilingual embedding models generate dense vector representations of text that capture semantic similarity across languages, making them ideal for global-scale applications. Their re-ranking models further enhance search quality by reordering retrieved results based on contextual relevance, improving precision in top-k retrieval tasks. Together, they form a powerful stack for building intelligent, LLM-enhanced search systems.
