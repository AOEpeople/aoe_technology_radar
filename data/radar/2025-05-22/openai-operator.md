[OpenAI Operator](https://openai.com/index/introducing-operator/) is an AI agent that can autonomously control computers and browsers to complete tasks without human assistance. Launched in January 2025, Operator transforms AI from a passive tool to an active participant in the digital ecosystem, operating as a browser-based autonomous agent.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Autonomous browser navigation and control
