[Atla Selene](https://atla-ai.com/) is a state-of-the-art LLM Judge trained specifically to evaluate generative AI responses. Selene excels at evaluating LLM outputs by other models involving language, coding, math, chat, RAG contexts, and more.

You can integrate Selene directly into your codebase using our Python SDK.

**Key Capabilities:**

- Automated code documentation
- Code structure analysis
- API documentation generation
- Change impact analysis
- Integration with version control
- Custom documentation templates
- Team collaboration features
- Multi-language support

**[Documentation](https://docs.atla.ai/)**

MOHARA should evaluate use of the Atla Selene model for projects requiring automated evaluation of LLM outputs, particularly when building AI applications that need reliable quality assessment, benchmarking different models, or implementing automated testing of generative AI components.
