[pg_vector] is a PostgreSQL extension that adds native vector indexing and similarity search capabilities directly to your Postgres database. This offers significant benefit in set-up, development and maintenance by avoiding the need for a separate, dedicated vector database that would require additional infrastructure, querying and syncing efforts.

MOHARA is has adopted the use of pg_vector to provide vector capabilities to the supabase-managed postgres database that forms part of teh Mo Stack boilerplate.
