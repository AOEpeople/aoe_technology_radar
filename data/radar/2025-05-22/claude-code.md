[Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) is Anthropic's CLI AI coding assistant powered by Claude 3 Opus and Sonnet models. It provides an agentic approach to software development, allowing developers to interact with codebases through natural language while maintaining precise control over code modifications.

**Key Capabilities:**

- Command-line interface for direct codebase interaction
- Autonomous code reading, writing, and testing
- Git and version control integration
- Support for multiple parallel coding tasks
- IDE integration through VS Code and JetBrains extensions
- Customizable workflows through configuration files
- Multi-instance support for parallel development
- Context-aware code understanding and modification

MOHARA should assess Claude Code for its potential to enhance development workflows, particularly its ability to handle complex coding tasks autonomously while maintaining developer oversight. The tool's integration with existing development practices and focus on safety makes it a promising addition to our AI-assisted development toolkit.
