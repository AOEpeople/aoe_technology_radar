Amazonâ€™s [Titan](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/amazon-models/titan/) models, available via AWS Bedrock, offer general-purpose text models across `Premier` (powerful), `Express` (efficient), and `Lite` (cost-effective) categories. These models support a range of use cases from content generation to summarization and reasoning.

In addition to text generation models, **Amazon Titan also includes embedding models** that produce dense vector representations of text for use in semantic search, clustering, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). These embeddings are optimized for integration with AWS-native services such as OpenSearch and Amazon Kendra, offering a seamless path to deploy scalable, enterprise-grade vector search systems.

MOHARA is keeping Titan on hold as we compare cost-performance trade-offs against our existing providers. Current Titan model performance does not warrant further assessment.
