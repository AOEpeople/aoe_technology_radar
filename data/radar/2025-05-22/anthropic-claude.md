Anthropicâ€™s [Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/claude) is a family of leading models focused on safety and reliability. Claude models offer advanced reasoning capabilities and are exceptionally well suited for code generation, as well as vision analysis and multilingual processing, making them suitable for a variety of AI-driven applications. In order of highest intelligence, the models are grouped into the categories `Opus` (high intelligence), `Sonnet` (high efficiency), and `Haiku` (high speed and lightweight).

> Note: The Claude models are state of the art but can become prohibitively expensive at large inference volumes.
