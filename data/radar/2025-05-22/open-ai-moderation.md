[OpenAI-Moderation-API] (https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation/quickstart) is a powerful tool for detecting and filtering harmful or sensitive content generated or submitted by users in AI-driven applications. It evaluates text against categories like hate speech, self-harm, sexual content, and violence, returning structured scores and flags to help developers enforce content safety policies. Itâ€™s particularly useful in chatbots, social platforms, and any application leveraging LLMs where user interaction must be moderated in real time. Apple's iOS app review is strict enforcing content filtering on LLM generated content within your app.
