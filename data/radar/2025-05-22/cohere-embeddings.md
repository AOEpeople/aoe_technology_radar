[Cohere-Embeddings] (https://docs.cohere.com/v2/docs/embeddings) and Reranking Models offer high-performance tools for building semantic search, recommendation systems, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines. Cohereâ€™s multilingual embedding models generate dense vector representations of text that capture semantic similarity across languages, making them ideal for global-scale applications. Their reranking models further enhance search quality by reordering retrieved results based on contextual relevance, improving precision in top-k retrieval tasks. Together, they form a powerful stack for building intelligent, LLM-enhanced search systems.
