OpenAI's [GPT models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview) are a family of state-of-the-art, general-purpose vision and language models that excel at natural language understanding, generation, reasoning, and multimodal processing. The variety of models includes high-intelligence chat models, reasoning models, lightweight and fast-inference `mini` models, and the `o-series` reasoning models that excel at complex, multi-step tasks.
