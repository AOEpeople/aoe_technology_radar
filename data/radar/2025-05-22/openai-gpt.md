OpenAI's [GPT models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview) are a family of state-of-the-art, general-purpose vision and language models that excel at natural language understanding, generation, reasoning, and multimodal processing. The variety of models includes high-intelligence chat models, reasoning models, lightweight and fast-inference `mini` models, and the `o-series` reasoning models that excel at complex, multi-step tasks.

In addition to language generation, OpenAI provides [embedding](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings) models that generate high-dimensional vector representations of text. These embeddings are widely used in semantic search, recommendations, clustering, and RAG pipelines. They are fast, robust, and compatible with a variety of vector database systems, enabling performant retrieval-based AI workflows.

OpenAI also offers the [Moderation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation/quickstart) API, a key tool for filtering harmful or sensitive content. It analyzes user-generated input and model output for categories such as hate speech, self-harm, sexual content, and violenceâ€”returning structured flags to help enforce content safety. This is especially important for production apps, as platforms like Apple require strong safeguards for generative content.

Further expanding their multimodal capabilities, OpenAI provides **speech-to-text (STT)** services via Whisper models, delivering highly accurate, multilingual transcription and translation from audio. Complementing this, OpenAI also supports **text-to-speech (TTS)** functionalities that generate natural, expressive speech from text for voice-enabled applications.

**Provisioning Platforms:**

- [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/)
- [Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service) on Azure AI Foundry

**Model Capabilities:**

- Text generation: conversation, creative writing, summarization
- Comprehension: reading, interpretation of complex documents
- Reasoning: multi-step logic, code analysis, math problem-solving
- Multimodal: text, image, audio, PDF file understanding
- Speech-to-text: accurate, multilingual audio transcription and translation (Whisper)
- Text-to-speech: natural and expressive voice synthesis
- Embeddings: semantic search, RAG, classification, clustering
- Moderation: real-time filtering of harmful or sensitive content
- Multilingual support: supports text understanding and generation in over 60 languages

MOHARA has adopted GPT chat models across various workflows due to their consistent performance, broad community support, and vibrant ecosystem. Advanced reasoning, multimodal, and speech capabilities continue to drive significant value, making it a foundational tool within our AI stack.
