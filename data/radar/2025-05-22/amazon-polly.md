[Amazon Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/) is a cloud-based text-to-speech (TTS) service that converts written text into lifelike speech using deep learning. It supports dozens of languages and voices, including neural TTS models that offer natural intonation and expressiveness. Polly is ideal for voice-enabling applications like virtual assistants, accessibility tools, IVR systems, and educational platforms.

Polly provides both real-time streaming and file-based synthesis, with flexible output formats (MP3, OGG, PCM) and SSML support for fine-grained control over speech style, rate, and emphasis. It integrates natively with other AWS services, making it easy to add high-quality speech output into cloud-hosted applications.

**Provisioning Platforms:**

- AWS Console
- AWS SDKs / CLI
- [Amazon Polly API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/API_Reference.html)

MOHARA has adopted Polly for use cases requiring high-quality voice synthesis, particularly in accessibility features and AI-driven learning applications. Its AWS-native integration and neural voice quality make it a strong candidate in text-to-speech applications.
