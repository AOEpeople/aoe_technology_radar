**Reason for selection**

Lynx is the first credible React Native rival: Rust tooling, dual-threaded UI engine and proven at TikTok scale. Early exploration now could position us for future performance wins.  

**Key questions**

- How easy is it to build and iterate?  
- Overall DX versus React Native + Expo.  
- Responsiveness & runtime performance.  
- Deployment complexity.  
- Feature parity (image manipulation, Bluetooth, etc.).  

**Assessment approach**

1. Build a small POC replicating core app patterns.  
2. Research unsupported but important features.  
3. Compare Expo/EAS deployment workflow and performance metrics.  

**Potential testers**

- Senior mobile devs (Tom, Morgs, Gam).
