**Reason for selection**

Besides the obvious hype, agent-assisted IDEs promise major speed and quality gains. Picking the best-in-class tools and standardising workflows should keep MOHARA competitive and accelerate delivery.  

**Key questions**

- Can we build complex apps end-to-end in an agentic flow?  
- Which IDE offers the best developer experience (DX)?  
- Does AI effectiveness drop as a project matures?  
- What "works" when coding with agentsâ€”best practices, common pitfalls?  

**Assessment approach**

1. Desk research on current best practices.  
2. Build the *same* small project in Cursor, Windsurf, Zed, VS Code + Copilot, etc.  
3. Optionally pilot on real projects and capture metrics.  
4. Consolidate findings into a best-practice guide.  

**Potential testers**

- Any engineer keen to try AI IDEs.

**Notes**

Could be run as an open bake-off if we define a tight rubric.
