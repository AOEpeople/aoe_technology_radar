**Reason for selection**

TanStack Start promises a Next-like full-stack experience minus the Vercel lock-in, with first-class routing, SSR/streaming and server RPCs. Exploring it expands our hosting options.  

**Key questions**

- DX vs Next JS (fast refresh, RSC support, docs).  
- Deployment flexibility to non-Vercel hosts.  
- Migration path from Next JS projects.  
- How well does it handle server components and auth flows?  

**Assessment approach**

1. Build a small full-stack POC (AI, auth, RSC, Supabase) in our mo-stack.  
2. Repeat inside an AI-agentic IDE to gauge productivity delta.  
3. Evaluate MCP server integration.  

**Potential testers**

- Senior full-stack devs (Fuzzy, Birdy, Milk).  

**Notes**

Curious to see how the built-in MCP server accelerates agent workflows.
