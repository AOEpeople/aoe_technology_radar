[Tanstack Start](https://tanstack.com/start/latest) is a full-stack React framework powered by [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest). It provides a full-document SSR, streaming, server functions, bundling, and more using tools like [Nitro](https://nitro.build/) and [Vite](https://vite.dev/).

MOHARA has placed TanStack Start in the “Hold” ring of our tech radar as we evaluate its maturity and potential benefits. As part of the TanStack ecosystem—which includes industry standards like TanStack Query—TanStack Start builds on this robust foundation. If adopted, it could serve as a replacement or alternative to our current use of Next.js and the T3 Framework. A key advantage of TanStack Start is its potential to broaden our hosting options, reducing our reliance on Vercel. As such, it will be carefully assessed to determine its fit for our needs.
