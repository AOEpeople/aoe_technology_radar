[tRPC](https://trpc.io/) (TypeScript Remote Procedure Call) is a lightweight framework for building end-to-end typesafe APIs in TypeScript without code generation or runtime bloat. It enables developers to define API endpoints and handle requests using TypeScript types, ensuring type safety between the client and server.
