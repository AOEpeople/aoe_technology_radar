# How to use the Technology Radar

### Introduction

We make use of a Technology Radar to visualise our current strategy in the field of spatial omics. This radar shows which technologies we are using actively, which ones we are assessing, etcâ€¦
The concept of the Technology radar is popularised by [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/byor).
Most of the platform and techniques overview comes from a substack article by http://albertvilella.substack.com/

### How do we maintain it?

The Spatial Omics Analysis Radar is currently maintained by Hugo Steenberghen. It is open for contribution from everyone in our organization and relies on their active participation to share insights, experiences, and best practices in applying spatial omics technologies.
