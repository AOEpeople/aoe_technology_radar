# How to use the Technology Radar

### Introduction

We make use of a Technology Radar to visualise our current tech strategy. This radar shows which technologies we are using actively, which ones we are assessing, etcâ€¦
The concept of the Technology radar is popularised by [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/byor).

### How do we maintain it?

The technology radar is maintained by everyone in the Software & IT architecture team. It is open for contribution for everyone in BioLizard and depends on their active participation to share lessons learned, pitfalls, and contribute to good practices on using the technologies.
