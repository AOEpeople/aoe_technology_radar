# Use GitBook to edit your forked tech radar repository

For those you, who want to use Git but want a WYSIWYG editor, [GitBook](https://help.gitbook.com/basics/what-is-gitbook.html) is an alternative. GitBook is the Git online Markdown WYSIWYG editor. From GitBook, you can [log in to GitBook with your GitHub account and sync your forked Tech Radar repository](https://help.gitbook.com/github/can-i-host-on-github.html) and edit WYSIWYG online.

Please remember, even though GitBook is WYSIWYG, you are still working with your forked tech radar repository: you must still only work with the "PrepareContent" branch. From the home page of your GitBook, go to **"Settings" &gt; "Options"** and in the **"Publication Section"**, select** "PrepareContent"** as your default branch and **"Save"** these settings. This way you only have to configure this once.![](/assets/images/2018-02-14-15_00_02-Options-Technology-Radar-Work-GitBook.png)
