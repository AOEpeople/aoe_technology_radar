In the past, we used a custom-developed ui-and-deviceset with Xataface,T3Deploy and a settings migration tool as an easy way to manage TYPO3- and Magento-related configurations and to automatically create environments on our shared integration/dev-servers.

Today, there is no advantage or need for Xataface. Don't use it anymore
