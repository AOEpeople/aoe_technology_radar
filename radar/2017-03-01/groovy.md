Groovy is a dynamically typed compiled language running on the JVM. It is easy to learn as it provides a familiar syntax for Java programmers, but also offers advanced features such as closures and makes some mandatory Java syntax requirements optional to enhance the conciseness of the code. These features make Groovy especially well-suited for scripting and domain-specific languages. This is used by popular tools such as Gradle or Spock.

At AOE, Groovy is used in many projects and areas. We use Gradle as a build system, we carry out unit and integration testing with Spock and Geb, we generate Jenkins jobs with JobDSL and we implement complete services with Groovy and [Spring Boot](/languages-and-frameworks/spring-boot.html).
