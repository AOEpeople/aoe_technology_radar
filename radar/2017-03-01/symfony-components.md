Symfony Components are part of the [Symfony Framework](https://symfony.com/) and they are designed as decoupled and reusable PHP components.

Their use cases vary from simple little helpers such as a [beautified var_dump](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/var_dumper.html) to more complex ones such as access control, list-based [security mechanisms](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/security.html) and an easy-to-integrate [console component](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console.html) to give your already existing applications some CLI capabilities. They are [used by a lot of PHP-based projects](http://symfony.com/projects) such as Typo3, Magento, Composer, PHPUnit and Doctrine, with contributions continually taking place. If you are planning the next project with PHP components, you should have a look at the [Symfony Components list](http://symfony.com/components), which includes a lot of well-designed, decoupled [Open Source pieces of PHP code](https://github.com/symfony).
