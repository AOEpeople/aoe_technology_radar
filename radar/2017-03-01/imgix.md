[Imgix](https://www.imgix.com/)Â is an SaaS solution for delivering and processing images. When developing responsive websites, you will quickly reach the point where you need various versions of your images to achieve a good responsive user interface. You want high quality versions for retina displays but small versions for mobile devices with a slow Internet connection.

Especially when dealing with user-generated uploads, it is getting hard to create different versions for any supported device and breakpoint of your web page. Doing this manually is hardly an option.

At AOE, we decided to use imgix as an image processing service for some projects to solve this problem. The benefits of imgix are the simple API to create responsive images in real-time as well as the fast delivery over their CDN.
