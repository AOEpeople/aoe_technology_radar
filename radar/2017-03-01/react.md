React claims to be "the V in MVC". But for us it is much more than that. React
improved the way we approach frontend applications as we build them. Its
functional way of writing components and its declarative JSX syntax help us to
build interactive UIs very efficiently. React's one-way data flow keeps
everything modular and fast and makes even large applications more readable.

Components are the central point of React - once we fully started
[thinking in react](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html),
our components became smaller, more reusable and better testable.

After some 1.5 years of experience with React and the steady growth of the
community and ecosystem around it, we can confidently say that we still see
great protential to build upcoming projects with React.
