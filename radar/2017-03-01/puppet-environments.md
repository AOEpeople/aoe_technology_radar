Puppet
------

Puppet is an Open Source configuration management tool. It is used by a wide range of different companies world-wide, e.g. the Wikimedia Foundation, Mozilla, Reddit, CERN, Dell, Rackspace, Twitter, the New York Stock Exchange, PayPal, Disney, Citrix Systems, Spotify, Oracle, the University of California Los Angeles, the University of North Texas, QVC, Intel, Google and others.

Puppet has been the basic tool to address Continuous Configuration Automation (CCA) in AOE's [Infrastructure as Code](/methods-and-patterns/infrastructure-as-code.html) strategy (IaC) for more than 4 years.

Puppet Environments
-------------------

Intended to give projects the means to develop and maintain their own infrastructure, separated and not influenced by other projects, Puppet environments, together with Puppet module versioning and ENC, have been introduced.\
Puppet Environments are rated "Trial". It supports our strategy of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and links it to our DevOps approach, enabling project teams to set up and customize their own infrastructure.

Teams that want to use the Puppet Environments service from the AOE IT Team will find detailed information about the implemented CI/CD process for this.
