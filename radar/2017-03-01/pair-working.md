We summarized the practices of pair programming and administrating as pair working.

Derived as a practice from eXtreme Programming (XP), pair programming is a method/pattern that aims for fine-scaled feedback within a team.

At AOE, some developers and operators work in pairs, not constantly, but from time to time. Most teams have positive experiences using this method, but not all teams tried the by-the-book-approach (driver and navigator principle). Especially for non-trival tasks, pair working results in rapid knowlegde exchange and better results with less bugs. We encourage the teams to try this approach more often.
