[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a language that gets transpiled to native JavaScript code.

It offers support for the latest EcmaScript features and has strict typing and support for interfaces built in.

JavaScript scoping, which led into recurring workarounds such as **var self = this, myFunc.bind(this)_,_**was eliminated in TypeScript.

In TypeScript **this** stays **this**, which leads to more readable and understandable code from an OOP perspective.

TypeScript continues to be actively developed by Microsoft and is well-Integrated in today's IDEs.

The excellent structure and the possibilities for extension make it a good choice to consider for larger JavaScript projects.

Typescript was the choice for [Angular](/languages-and-frameworks/angular.html) and one can assume that it will get more traction with the success of Angular in the future.

There are also projects that support Typescript „code execution“ on the server such as [ts-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node).
