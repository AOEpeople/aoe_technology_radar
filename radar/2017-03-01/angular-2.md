The latest version of the Angular Framework, which is used for large single-page applications.

[Angular 2](https://angular.io/) is a complete rewrite of Angular 1 â€” any many things have changed compared to the first version. The latest best practices and toolings from the JavaScript community have found their way into Angular2.

It supports DI (dependency injection), it has a clean inheritance and a good separation of concerns. Angular2 follows the [web component standards](https://www.w3.org/standards/techs/components#w3c_all) to avoid negative side effects between components.

We think that Angular2+ is well-structured on both a development and an application level.

When talking about Angular2, we must consider the [angular.cli](https://cli.angular.io/) as well, which provides a huge level of intelligent automation along the development process and project setup.
