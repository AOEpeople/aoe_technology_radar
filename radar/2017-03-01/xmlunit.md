[XMLUnit](http://www.xmlunit.org/) is a Java and .NET testing framework for XML documents. It is very useful for performing contract tests with SOAP interfaces or other XML-based message types.

Comparing strings of XML can lead to instable tests because of the changing order of elements or changed values, etc. XMLUnit provides features to address these issues. It is possible to validate against an XML Schema, use XPath queries or compare against expected outcomes. It also comes with a nice diff-engine which makes it easy to check the parts of an XML document that are important.
