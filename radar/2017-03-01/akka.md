With the growing adoption of microservice-based architecures, the interest in frameworks and tools that make building systems that follow the reactive manifesto possible has increased.

Akka provides you a toolkit and runtime based on the Actor model known from Erlang to reach this goal.

It's one of the most-adopted toolkits in its space with its key contributors beeing heavily involved in the overall movement of the reactive community as well.
At AOE, we use Akka when we need high-performance, efficient data processing or where its finite state machine plays nicely with the domain of the application. It is worth mentioning that the actor model might come with extra complexity and therefore should be used in problem spaces where the advantages of this approach bring enough value and no accidental complexity.
