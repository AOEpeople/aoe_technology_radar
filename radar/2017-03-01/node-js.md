Node.js is a no- browser JavaScript execution runtime. Its basis is Google's V8 engine. [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) is event-driven and follows a non-blocking I/O model.

Itâ€™s a good choice for restful APIs, realtime purposes or situations where many concurrent connections are expected, where each connection has a lightweight memory footprint.

Node allows separation of concerns by using its package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), which is also the largest ecosystem of Open Source libraries (modules).

Modules are added as dependencies and offer a wide range of functionalities in a range from simple helper functions to mature web frameworks such as [express.js](http://expressjs.com/de/).

Many PaaS providers (AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Azure) support node, including deployment and monitoring services out of the box for scalable stateless applications.

At AOE, we successfully use node.js-based applications for smaller services or internal tools such dashboards.
