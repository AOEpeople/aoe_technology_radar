[Flow](https://flow.neos.io/) is a PHP web application framework developed for the [Neos](https://www.neos.io/) project.

We used Flow in a couple of projects and decided to put it on hold for the following reasons:

*   slow during development and hard to debug because of its need to "compile" the application to integrate e.g. AOP
*   limited documentation and community
*   development of the framework is closely coupled to the progress of the Neos project

Although it could be that some of the above-mentioned aspects have improved in the past, we decided to use other PHP frameworks such as [Symfony](http://symfony.com/) or other Languages (See [Go](/languages-and-frameworks/go-lang.html); [Play Framework](/languages-and-frameworks/play-framework.html); [Spring Boot](/languages-and-frameworks/spring-boot.html))
