## Definition ##

Data platform is a type of IT solution that combines the features and capabilities of several data application and sources across company's data landscape within a single solution. It is a platform that enables organization developing, deploying, operating and managing a data infrastructure /environment. 
Data platform generally consists of storage, servers, databases, big data solutions, BI/Analytics and data management utilities. It also supports integration with other systems.

## Why? ##

- Remove data silos by creating common Data Platform integrating all valuable data sources and data engines across company.

- Enable scalable, agile and future-proof company-wide data architecture and ecosystem

- Enable data democratisation and data-driven decisions by implementing self-service BI/Analytics/Reporting

- Enrich products with embedded BI/Analytic/Reporting and analytics-driven functionality

- Enable data-driven product development

- Provides discovery and fast prototyping environment for data-driven experimentation and innovation.

- Lowers maintenance costs and workload by reducing the complexity of multiple data integration vendors/solutions into a one cohesive solution

- Removes direct dependences between data systems and applications ("decoupling"), allowing more flexible and agile new products and solutions development.

- Removes currently existing bottlenecks for analysing, cleansing and delivering data.


## Technology choices/solutions ##

Currently concept is under discussion with Data Lake being preffered solution.

Data Lake - centralised repository of enterprise data that can meet the needs of various application workloads that gain efficiency through the reusability and consistency of data.
