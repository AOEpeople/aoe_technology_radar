## Why? ##

The market share of mobile devices grows constantly. Smartphones and tablets are used from more and more customers.
Internet usage with mobile devices is part of everyday life. The [Zenith study 2017](http://group/websites/prm/ProduktProjekte/PjM%20Dokumente/Anlage_Zenith-Mobile-Avertising-Forecast.pdf) states that mobile internet usage achieved 75% and will grow in the upcoming years.

That means that each solution team must have a strategy how to support mobile devices.
For some apps it is even the best to support only mobile devices.

With the rise of mobile devices a lot of different technical approaches and frameworks are offered to implement a mobile solution.

The range of mobile solution approaches reaches from web apps over hybrid apps to (cross-platform) native apps.
The article [Native, Web or Hybrid Apps?](https://www.mobiloud.com/blog/native-web-or-hybrid-apps/) gives an excellent overview about the different approaches and also a chapter, how to choose the right approach for your situation.
