## Why? ##

The market share of mobile devices grows constantly. Smartphones and tablets are used from more and more customers.
Internet usage with mobile devices is part of everyday life. The [Zenith study 2017](http://group/websites/prm/ProduktProjekte/PjM%20Dokumente/Anlage_Zenith-Mobile-Avertising-Forecast.pdf) states that mobile internet usage achieved 75% and will grow in the upcoming years.

<!-- The 75% has no context and, therefore, no value. 75% of what- world population? -->

That means that each solution team must have a strategy how to support mobile devices.
For some apps, it is even the best to support only mobile devices.

With the rise of mobile devices, a lot of different technical approaches and frameworks are offered to implement a mobile solution.

The range of mobile solution approaches includes web apps, hybrid apps, and (cross-platform) native apps.
The article [Native, Web or Hybrid Apps?](https://www.mobiloud.com/blog/native-web-or-hybrid-apps/) gives an excellent overview about the different approaches and there is also a chapter on "how to choose the right approach for your situation".
