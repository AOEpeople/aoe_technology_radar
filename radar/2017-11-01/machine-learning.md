## Definition ##

**Machine Learning** (ML) is one of the main drivers of the digital transformation. It not only enables deeper insights about the users of our products or the visitors of our shops and portals but also predicts their future behaviour and is able to take decisions on that.

ML is part of Artificial Intelligence (AI) which tries to mimic human intelligence by machines. It is also called the "weak" or "narrow" part of AI because it tries to solve one or a few specific problems at a time, f.e. recognizing faces on pictures or extracting the meaning from speech or text.

In ML you do no longer program rules but instead train the system to learn patterns by feeding it with input data. ML creates algorithms that are able to make predictions on new data. You can combine this intelligence with sensors and take automated decisions for you like i.e. automatic control of temperature or light in your home.

The term **"Deep Learning"** is a part of ML and is used for newer neural networks. These deep neural networks do not only have one but multiple hidden layers between the input and the output layer; each layer providing his learnings to the next one. Thus, Deep Learning is used for training complex pattern matching problems like face or language recognition. For training deep neural networks the amount of input data and efforts for preprocessing is much higher than "normal" ML.

A good commonly understandable introduction into ML you can find in the slidedeck from Jason Mayes:

## Areas of application, user benefit and correlated HG initiatives ##

The purpose of ML is to automatically learn patterns, apply them on new data, predict the desired information and optionally take decisions or actions from that. Raw data input may originate from text, pictures, videos, speech, behavioral or master data; data may be delivered in discrete files or as data streams, i.e. from sensors.  

Two main areas are predestined for ML usage at Haufe Group: 

1) **Product view**: How can ML support in creating data-driven or self-optimizing products? 

2) **Marketing view**: How can ML support Marketing teams to better understand the user/visitor and his context and provide the next best action to him?

Other application areas like self driving vehicles, medical diagnosis, games are mentioned under "3. others".

Mostly all current initiatives are in the state "Discovery" - proofing the value for us and our customers.
