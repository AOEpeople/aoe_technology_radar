## Why? ##

- Short description of the technolgy   
Keep it short and not too technical. The audience of the tech radar are all Haufe Group employees and not only the techies.
Use a language that also business people can understand. Use links to refer to content with deeper information.
- Business reasons why it is important for us   
Focus on the why we use it and not how it works.
Describe the business opportunities and the business value.
If the technology is necessary to enable another technology, please name it.
