## Why? ##

- Short description of the technolgy   
Keep it short and not to technical. The audience of the tech radar are all Haufe Group employees and not only the techies.
Use a language that also business people can understand. Use links to refer to content with deeper information.
- Business reasons why it is important for us   
Focus on the why we use it and not how it works.
Describe the business opportunities and the business value.
If the technology is necessary to enable another technology, please name it.

## Technology choices/solutions ##

List our prefered solutions. It's not necessary or a goal to list all possible solutions. Focus on what we use.

## Our projects ##

List of projects and activities. It's also a good idea to name the contact information for the activity.
This section is very important cause it documents at what level we are, regarding the usage and experience with the technolgy. 

## Contact ##

Name the main contact persons or unit.
Use <email@domain.com> for mail contact infos
