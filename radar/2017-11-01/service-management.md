We can decide to keep this topic extremely narrow and put the tool (ITSM, Service Now) into the focus or we can put the concept
‘everything a team needs to manage its service in operation’ in the focus.  I would go for the latter ... 

Ultimately it also leads to the concept of ‘local domain of control and global domain of visibility’ ..and who controls which aspects
