## Why? ##

The business needs of our customers are wide-spread. There is no chance to fulfill all of their needs with our own standard applications.
It is increasingly required that our applications are extendible and can interoperate with partner applications.
Business workflows and processes are complex and are often spread over multiple applications, including systems and solutions we do not offer ourselves.
Customers want to decide for themselves which appliaction they want to use for a specific functionality.
Haufe Group follows the strategy to work together with partners to offer better and new solutions.

To support automated and integrated processes, applications must have APIs.
