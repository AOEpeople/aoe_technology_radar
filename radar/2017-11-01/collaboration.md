## Why? ##

Most Haufe Group applications are designed as stand alone solutions.
Especially in domains where Haufe Group offers multiple solutions targeting the same customer collaboration of the solutions is a crucial selling point.
Currently the applications do not fully exploit their potential of collaboration to optimally support customers in their work processes.
Solution collaboration starts with a common login includes exchange of data, harmonised user inrterface and support of useful work processes that are not possible with a single solution.

It is a technical challenge to achieve that goal. Monolithic applications are definately not the answer.
**Highly aligned, loosely coupled** is a leading principal for the collaboration solution architecture.
Small focused applications and teams that provide their business value via API and a set of integration patterns are our approach.
