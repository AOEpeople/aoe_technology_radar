## Why? ##

Most Haufe Group applications are designed as stand alone solutions.
Especially in domains where Haufe Group offers multiple solutions targeting the same customer group, collaboration of the solutions is a crucial selling point.
Currently the applications do not fully exploit their potential of collaboration to optimally support customers in their work processes.
Solution collaboration starts with a common login includes exchange of data, harmonised user interface and support of useful work processes that are not possible with a single solution.

It is a technical challenge to achieve that goal. Monolithic applications are definitely not the answer.
[**Highly aligned, loosely coupled**](https://de.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664/94-Highly_Aligned_Loosely_Coupled_Highly) is a leading principal for the collaboration solution architecture.
Small focused applications and teams that provide their business value via API and a set of integration patterns are our approach.

Moving from monolithic, tightly integrated platform products to a portfolio of highly aligned, loosely coupled products requires a different product collaboration paradigm, best described in [‘Building Microservices’ (Sam Newman) chapter on Implementing Asynchronous Event-Based Collaboration](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/building-microservices/9781491950340/ch04.html#idm811600).
Other concepts would be async vs sync, and orchestration vs choreography, dumb networks and smart endpoints etc.
