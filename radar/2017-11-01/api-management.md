## Why?
With an exponential increase in the number of apps required in the digital world, businesses need to expose more data through APIs in order to provide richer and personalized app experiences both for internal users, customers, and partners. Public APIs foster innovation and allow you to bring new products and services to market faster. All these APIs require a strong API Management solution to measure performance and make business decisions based on API usage.

It enables you to create, secure, manage, scale and analyze APIs.
