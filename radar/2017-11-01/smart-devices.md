## Why? ##

A system of ubiquitous devices connecting the physical world to the cloud.
Although things, Internet, and connectivity are the three core components of IoT, the value is in closing the gap between the physical and digital world in self-reinforcing and self-improving systems.
If you knew the state of every thing in the world, and could reason on top of the data: What problems would you solve?

I would even go so far that smart devices like Alexa enable conversational commerce (see IRC blog article again) at a far greater scale than our mobile phones and require a new kind of UX (https://blog.ubisend.com/optimise-chatbots/what-is-conversational-ux) and interaction patterns.
