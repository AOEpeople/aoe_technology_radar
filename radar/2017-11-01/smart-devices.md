## Why? ##

The Internet of Things (IoT) represents devices, buildings, vehicles and more with sensors, software and network connectivity built into them. These things are connected to the Internet and to each other transmitting data and information to the people who use them. 

Main areas:

* Smart Homes
* Self-transportation/Car technology
* Healthcare
* Manufacturing
* Communication
* Energy
* Agriculture
* Logistics

A system of ubiquitous devices connecting the physical world to the cloud.
Although things, Internet, and connectivity are the three core components of IoT, the value is in closing the gap between the physical and digital world in self-reinforcing and self-improving systems.
