## State December 2017
Different approaches for ChatBots were developed during the last Hackathons. A Project for AKA & HCP starts in January, rolling out the existing prototypes.


## Why?

Instant Messaging Platforms like What’sApp, Facebook Messenger, etc. are still on the rise and enjoy a huge popularity regarding
communication. To get or stay in contact with our future and existing customers on these platforms it is necessary to use technologies,
like the little programs, that are called chatbots.

A definition of a ChatBot could be: 
It is a computer program, designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the
Internet.

For better understanding see this Video:

On Facebook for example already exist more than 100.000 ChatsBots, these little programs will shape the expactations of our customers in
the future more and more.

Furthermore: Because mobile is the new „normal“, and you look on the usage and browsing behavior of these devices, it’s
necessary to find ways to shape user experiences and customer touchpoints beyond our owned websites. On the other hand chatbots are a
great opportunity to deliver extraordinary customer experiences especially in the Service and eCommerce area. 24/7. 
If we look e.g. on WeChat (https://www.clickz.com/an-introduction-to-wechat-the-evolution-and-future-of-chinas-most-popularapp/111401/ ), the big Chinese Messenger Platform, you can see the potential of what could be possible.

In difference to classical Web-Interfaces, chatbots belong into a new and upcoming category called conversational interfaces. Speech and
Wording is used to shapen your brand. So everyone who’s designing a ChatBot have to keep this in mind.

Therfore this technology is relevant for all units and departments.
