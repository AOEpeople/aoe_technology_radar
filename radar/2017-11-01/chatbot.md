## State December 2017
Different approaches for ChatBots were developed during the last Hackathons. A project for AKA & HCP starts in January, rolling out the existing prototypes.


## Why?

Instant Messaging Platforms like What’sApp, Facebook Messenger, etc. are still on the rise and enjoy a huge popularity regarding
communication. To get or stay in contact with our future and existing customers on these platforms it is necessary to use technologies,
like the little programs, that are called chatbots.

A definition of a ChatBot could be:
It is a computer program, designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the
Internet.

For better understanding see this Video:

On Facebook, for example, already exist more than 100.000 ChatsBots. These little programs will shape the expectations of our customers in the future more and more.

Furthermore: If you look on the usage and browsing behavior of mobile devices, that are the new „normal“, it’s
necessary to find ways to shape user experiences and customer touchpoints beyond our owned websites. Therfore chatbots are a
great opportunity to deliver extraordinary customer experiences especially in the customer service and eCommerce area. 24/7. 

If you look for example on WeChat, the big Chinese Messenger Platform, you can see the potential of what could be possible. For further information read: https://www.clickz.com/an-introduction-to-wechat-the-evolution-and-future-of-chinas-most-popularapp/111401/ 

In difference to classical Web-Interfaces, ChatBots belong into a new and upcoming category called "conversational interfaces".
Classical branding elements like logos, typo, images are missing here or are defined by the messenger service itself. Therefore speech
and wording are the driving factors that shapen your brand. So everyone who’s designing a ChatBot have to keep this in mind.

All the FAMA (Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple) are offering frameworks, where you can build upon. But, in comparison to many other tpics, here not the technology is the challenging aspect. The most challenging is the design of the dialog as well to train the Bot, that response are in the way you want.
