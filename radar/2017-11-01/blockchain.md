## Why? ##

### What is blockchain? ###

A blockchain is a digitized, decentralized, public ledger of all digital (often cryptocurrency) transactions. It allows market participants to keep track of digital transactions without central recordkeeping or authority. The blockchain is immutable. You cannot change the entries. You can only add entries. The blockchain is unhackable.

> “The blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just
> financial transactions but virtually everything of value.”
Don & Alex Tapscott, authors Blockchain Revolution (2016)
