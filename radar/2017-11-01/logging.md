## Why? ##

After development, any application/service is stripped of debugging functionality or instrumentation.

The only chance to keep an eye out for success/failure is to observe the system(s) for

- logging information
- monitoring data
- telemetric data

### Logging ###

... is providing information from "inside" the application/service about:

- events (user interaction, incoming requests, ...)
- actions (processing data, writing files, sending messages, ...)
- issues (low memory, exhausted storage, unreachable services, ...)
- ...

Logging data is required to give proof of **correct execution** (and thereby can be used for solving problems). It is very likely organized along the structure and architecure of the software.
