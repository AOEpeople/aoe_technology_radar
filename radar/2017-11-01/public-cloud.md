## Why? ##

The public cloud provides infrastructure like (computing power, storage, network ...) and managed services.
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) gives us the chance to automate our deployments and to maintain our released version in way it is not possible with traditional hosteres.
The public cloud gives us:

- Flexibility   
  Start with a minimal set of resources and grow when it's necessary.
- Control   
  Operate the solutions and immedeately have access to monitoring and logging data.
- Speed   
  Deployments are done in minutes. Infrastructure changes can be done from the team.

It even can save costs when we use the public cloud infrastructure in an intelligent way and choose the application architecture accordingly.
Without public cloud continuous deployment (CD) is not possible for production.

## Technology choices/solutions ##

ICT and CTO agreed to support two public cloud providers.

- AWS (Amazon Web Services)
- Azure public and Azure DE

We have good connections with Amazon and Microsoft.

## Our projects ##

Some projects refactored their build pipelines and moved from traditionell hosters to the cloud.
New projects use the public cloud from the start. 

Some samples:
