## Why? ##

The public cloud provides infrastructure like (computing power, storage, network ...) and managed services.
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) gives us the chance to automate our deployments and to maintain our released software versions in a way that was not possible with traditional hosting services.

The public cloud gives us:

- Flexibility   
  Start with a minimal set of resources and grow as needed.
- Control   
  Operate the solutions and immediately have access to monitoring and logging data.
- Speed   
  Deployments are done in minutes. Infrastructure changes can be done by the team.

Cost savings are possible when we use the public cloud infrastructure in an intelligent way and choose the application architecture accordingly.
Without public cloud continuous deployment (CD) is not possible for production.

## Technology choices/solutions ##

ICT and CTO agree to support two public cloud providers.

- AWS (Amazon Web Services)
- Azure public and Azure DE

We have a good business relationship with both Amazon and Microsoft.

## Our projects ##

Some projects have refactored their build pipelines and moved their infrastructure from traditional hosters to the cloud.
New projects that use the public cloud from the start.
