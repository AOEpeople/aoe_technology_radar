## Why? ##

The public cloud provides infrastructure like (computing power, storage, network ...) and managed services.
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) gives us the chance to automate our deployments and to maintain our released version in way it is not possible with traditional hosteres.
The public cloud gives us:

- Flexibility   
  We can Start with minimal set of resources and can choose to increase when we need to.
- Control   
  We operate our solutions and have access to monitoring information and logging data.
- Speed   
  Deployments are done in minutes. Infrastructure changes can be done immediately.

It even can save costs when we use the public cloud infrastructure in an intelligent way and choose the application architecture accordingly.
Without public cloud continuous deployment (CD) is not possible for production.
