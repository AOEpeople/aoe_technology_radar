## Why? ##

The world is moving to a direction where everything will be connected. APIs are a concrete way for apps to communicate and to collaborate.
Haufe Group is convinced to use APIs and [API-Management](./../infrastructure-and-operational-technology/api-management.html) solutions.

The more [API-Management](./../infrastructure-and-operational-technology/api-management.html) instances we will have, the bigger the need for a API Discovery service.

- Is there already functionality that I can use?
- How do I find it?
- How many APIs are there in Haufe Group?

## Technology choices/solutions ##

There are not many solutions to use.

- [apis.io](http://apis.io/)

## Our projects ##

We started an initiative to install and use [apis.io](http://apis.io/) for our purposes.
The initiative should be finished in Q1/2018.
