# Contributing to the Tech Radar

always happy to get contributions

Tech radar is a curated overview of the most important technologies that are currently relevant to the Haufe Group technology strategy and Haufe Group product development. The tech radar tends to focus on technology concepts like Blockchain or Machine Learning and not on specific technologies like JavaScript or No-SQL-databases. The reason for this is that the technology radar serves the purpose of informing everyone at Haufe Group about new technology that can enable their product - whether it be an internal or customer-facing.

It's a good idea to keep this in mind when you decide that you want to contribute to the tech radar because, really, the idea behind the radar blips is to help start conversations - among all job roles at Haufe Group - about how which technologies can be used to improve or create new products for Haufe Group.

The content for the tech radar is stored a GitHub repository and edited in Git Markdown format. To be able to contribute, you must know how \(or know someone\) to [make a pull request from a forked GitHub repository](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/). Contributions are reviewed through the Git contribution workflow.

It's also a good idea to follow these steps, when contributing information.

## Inform the Tech Innovation Cell

Since the tech radar is curated, the first step is to tell us what you wish to contribute. You can let us know in various ways

* E-mail to [\_kickstarter\_customer\_success\_new\_tech@haufe-lexware.com](mailto:_kickstarter_customer_success_new_tech@haufe-lexware.com?subject=Tech Radar Contribution).
* Rocket chat in the "Tech Radar" channel.
* Jabber to us in the Jabber "Tech Radar" channel
* Make an "content-less" pull request - **from your forked GitHub repository** - with a comment what you wish to contribute to [https://github.com/Haufe-Lexware/aoe\_technology\_radar](https://github.com/Haufe-Lexware/aoe_technology_radar/tree/PrepareContent "The Tech Radar Git repository").

When we receive your request, we'll contact you to talk about it and to see if it's something the tech radar is ready for.

## Contributing content

There are various ways to to contribute content. For folks, who don't want to contribute over Git, there are German and English Microsoft Word templates that you can use to structure your content. Just ask for them.

If you are going to contribute over Git, the recommended workflow is for you to [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/ "How to fork a Git repo") the [https://github.com/Haufe-Lexware/aoe\_technology\_radar](https://github.com/Haufe-Lexware/aoe_technology_radar) repository to your own Git account. Create and edit your content from your forked repository and make a pull request inside of the "PrepareContent" branch \(Select the "PrepareContent" branch in your fork\).

Documentation for [forking](https://www.gitbook.com/book/sspeights/technology-radar-work/edit#) and[ pull requests](https://www.gitbook.com/book/sspeights/technology-radar-work/edit#) is linked. But, if you have any questions about forking a repository or creating a pull request, please contact us.

## Editing content

There are several way to edit Git Markdown. People, who work with GitHub on a regular basis should feel free to use an IDE to contribute and edit Tech Radar content. Remember if you are working with a Git repo you always want to work from the "PrepareContent" branch and never from "master" branch!

Using Git from the Git Bash is not described here. If you want to use bash commands to manage your content, we assume you know how to do it already.

### Microsoft Word templates

For those of you, who don't want to work with Git at all, just request the English or German Microsoft Word templates and someone will enter the content for you when editing is finished.

### Using GitBook to edit your forked Tech Radar repository

For those you, who want to use Git but want a WYSIWYG editor, GitBook is an alternative. GitBook is the Git online Markdown WYSIWYG editor. From GitBook, you can log in to GitBook with your GitHub account and sync your forked Tech Radar repository and edit WYSIWYG online.

Please remember, even though GitBook is WYSIWYG, you are still working with your forked Git repository: you must still only work with the "PrepareContent" branch. From the home page of your GitBook, go to "Settings" &gt; "Options" and in the "Publication Section", select "PrepareContent" as your default branch. This way you only have to configure this once.

### Editing from GitBook editor

All Tech Radar content is under the "radar" folder in date stamped folders.

To start working, Click "Edit" from your GitBook home page, to open the edit dialog - since this is not really a GitBook, select "Files" in the upper right corner to the see the content. to create your content --

* Create a file with the name of the technology you are contributing: all lower-case with hyphen separators.
* Open the \_template.md file and copy the contents.
* Paste these contents into your new file and change the information to fit your contribution.
* Edit using the toolbar in the upper-right corner.
* Click "Publish" \(CTRL + S\) in the upper-right corner to push your changes.
