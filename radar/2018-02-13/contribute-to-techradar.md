# Contributing to the Tech Radar

always happy to get contributions

tech radar is a curated overview of the most important technologies that are currently relevant to the Haufe Group technology strategy and Haufe Group product development. The tech radar tends to focus on technology concepts like Blockchain or Machine Learning and not on specific technologies like JavaScript or No-SQL-databases. The reason for this is that the technology radar serves the purpose of informing everyone at Haufe Group about new technology that can enable their product - whether it be an internal or customer-facing.

It's a good idea to keep this in mind when you decide that you want to contribute to the tech radar because, really, the idea behind the radar blips is to help start conversations - among all job roles at Haufe Group - about how which technologies can be used to improve or create new products for Haufe Group.

The content for the tech radar is stored a GitHub repository and edited in Git Markdown format. To be able to contribute, you must know how \(or know someone\) to [make a pull request from a forked GitHub repository](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/). Contributions are reviewed through the Git contribution workflow.

It's also a good idea to follow these steps, when contributing information.

Create and edit your content from your forked repository and make a pull request inside of the "PrepareContent" branch \(Select the "PrepareContent" branch in your fork\).

If you have any questions about forking a repository or creating a pull request, please contact us.

## Editing content

There are several way to edit Git Markdown. People, who work with GitHub on a regular basis should feel free to use an IDE to contribute and edit Tech Radar content. Remember if you are working with a Git repo you always want to work from the "PrepareContent" branch and never from "master" branch!

### Microsoft Word templates

For those of you, who don't want to work with Git at all, just request the English or German Microsoft Word templates and someone will enter the content for you when editing is finished.

### Using GitBook to edit your forked Tech Radar repository

For those you, who want to use Git but want a Wysiwyg editor, GitBook is an alternative. GitBook is the Git online Markdown WYSIWYG editor. From GitBook, you can log in to GitBook with your GitHub account and sync your forked Tech Radar repository and edit WYSIWYG online.
