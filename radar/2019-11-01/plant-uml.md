[PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) is an open source project that allows to create UML diagrams in a declarative way.

Since it is integrated in tools like Confluence we use it a lot to quickly document results of software design sessions.

Another similar tools that use just plain javascript to render the diagrams is [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/)
