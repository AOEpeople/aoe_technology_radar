At AOE, we are using SonarQube to get a historical overview of the code quality in our Projects. With SonarQube, you can get a quick insight into the condition of your code. It analyzes many languages and provides numerous static analysis rules.
SonarQube is also being used for Static Application Security Testing (SAST) which scans our code for potential security vulnerabilities and is an essential element of our Secure Software Development Lifecycle.
