[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) is an API testing and documentation tool. Requests can be bundled into folders 
and easily be configured to be executed against multiple environments. Responses can be evaluated using the "test" feature.

Even automated testing is possible using [Newman](https://www.npmjs.com/package/newman) as an addition to Postman.
