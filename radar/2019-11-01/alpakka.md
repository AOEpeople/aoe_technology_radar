The ["Alpakka project"](https://doc.akka.io/docs/alpakka/current/index.html) is an open source initiative to implement stream-aware and reactive integration pipelines for Java and Scala. 
It is built on top of Akka Streams, and has been designed from the ground up to understand streaming natively and provide a DSL for reactive and stream-oriented programming, with built-in support for backpressure.
