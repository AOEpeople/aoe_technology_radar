Falco is an open source project for intrusion and abnormality detection for Cloud Native platforms such as Kubernetes. 
It detects abnormal application behavior and sends alerts via Slack, Fluentd, NATS, and more.

We are assessing Falco to add another angle to host based intrusion detection and alerting.
