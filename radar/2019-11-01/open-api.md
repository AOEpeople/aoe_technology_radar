The OpenAPI Specification is becoming a broadly adopted industry standard for describing modern REST APIs. Other initiatives like RAML have [joined](https://blogs.mulesoft.com/dev/api-dev/open-api-raml-better-together/) the OpenAPI Initiative.

OpenAPI v2 version is basically the former Swagger - and Swagger provides useful tools for OpenAPI like the online editor and viewer http://editor.swagger.io/
We have also found that this version currently have a good tool support accross languages, so you will find API client and server generation tools for a lot of languages, which makes it quite easy to connect to an API that is described in OpenAPI standard.


**OpenAPI v3**

OpenAPI v3 adds more features to the specification - for example the ability to describe APIs supporting request/callback pattern.

There is a very good api designer https://www.apicur.io/ and a good mock generator http://microcks.github.io/index.html

The general tool support is excellent. See https://openapi.tools/
