STRIDE is a model of threat groups that helps to identify security threats to any application, component or infrastructure.

The acronym stands for:

* Spoofing
* Tampering
* Repudiation
* Information disclosure
* Denial of service
* Elevation of privilege

AOE is applying the threat model in collaborative sessions using the [Elevation of Privilege Card Game](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/285.elevation-of-privilege-the-game.aspx) which helps to spark imagination and makes threats more tangible.
