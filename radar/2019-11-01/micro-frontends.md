When deciding on a system architecture we are always striving for technology neutralism. This is to allow us to stay
flexible with future decisions. Micro Frontends can be a tool to support us with this goal.
We favor protocols and methods, such as plain HTML and HTTP, over specific technologies when designing Micro Frontends.

Since Micro Frontends have proven to allow use move fast and agile, we moved this pattern to "trial".
