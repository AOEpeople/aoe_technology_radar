The reactive style of programming promotes event-based thinking and modeling -- 
and by that assists in creating more decoupled solutions.

Synergies arise, when people understand the concepts of this pattern: by using marble diagrams, 
which are a de-facto standard in visualizing algorithms in a reactive style, a common ground for communication 
is available regardless of the programming language used.

When appropriate, we choose more explicitly the Reactive Programming pattern and therefore moved this to "adopt".
