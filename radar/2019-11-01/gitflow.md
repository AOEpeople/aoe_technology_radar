Ever since there are recurring discussions about the version control strategy that a team should use.

We have also made the experience when new teams start off with using blocking or long lived feature branches (merge late once all review comments are done) it has a negative impact on team performance.

We recommend to use trunk based development with short lived (<1day) feature branches, because this has shown to support continuous integration and team collaboration the best. However we do accept teams choices to use GitFlow, we just do not try to encourage them in the first place.
