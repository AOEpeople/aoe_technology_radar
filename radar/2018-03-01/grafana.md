[Grafana](https://grafana.com//) is an Open Source data visualization platform written in Go and NodeJS. It provides a vast choice of different graph types that can be easily combined into dashboards for displaying any kind of numerical or time-based data.

At AOE, we usually use Grafana in conjunction with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) or [AWS CloudWatch](https://prometheus.io/) for visualizing both application and infrastructure metrics.
