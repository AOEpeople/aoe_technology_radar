We are continuing to use Elasticsearch successfully in [SearchperienceÂ®] and have benefited from the aggregation features for related use cases such as rendering category trees.
We are also using Elasticsearch for some microservices as our persistence solution.

This is why we have updated its status to **adopt**.
