[Axure](https://www.axure.com/) is a tool that enables the creation of flowcharts, wireframes, mockups, user journeys and more.
Through features such as conditional logic, dynamic content and animations it is possible to create highly functional and rich UI prototypes, which convey a realistic look and feel as to how the application to be developed should behave and look.
 
We at AOE have used Axure successfully in several projects and it helped us a lot, particularly:
 - as a basis for discussing how features should look, feel and work with customers
 - as a basis for customers' discussions with other stakeholders
 - as a basis for discussion and specifications for developers as to how features should look and behave
 
In conclusion, Axure is a great tool that provides all stakeholders with a common understanding and helped us a lot to specify requirements and find their implications.
