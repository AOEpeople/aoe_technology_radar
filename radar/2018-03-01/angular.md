In addition to numerous major upgrades from version 2 to 5, which often needed a "hands-on" approach, a lot has happened in the Angular 
ecosystem in 2017. Specifically, the improvements in the HTTP-Client, which now requires less coding effort. Or 
the vast improvements on angular.cli such as aot (ahead of time compile) for faster rendering, fewer requests and 
much smaller builds, to just name the most important ones.

We have achieved particularly good results using Angular in large and medium-size projects. Actually, 
it's our framework-of-choice in our telecommunication sector teams as a single-page application framework (SPA) for microservice front 
ends.

The convenient scaffolding of unit- and end-to-end-tests provides a quality-driven workflow.
Also, the module- and component architecture helps to keep the codebase understandable end maintainable.
