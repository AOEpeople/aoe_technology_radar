Invision is an online tool used to work and collaborate on design and prototypes and to share them between clients and the team.

We use it in many projects now to present prototypes and designs and it helps in understanding the planned user experience.
Also, we use this directly as a reference from the user stories to help the development teams in understanding and implementing the right frontend and backend functionalities.
