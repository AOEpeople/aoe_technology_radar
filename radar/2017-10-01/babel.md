We have been using babel for some time now. Since we have started using it, we don't have to
struggle with unimplemented features of ECMAScript. In this regard, JavaScript is
JavaScript, no matter what browser you are using. We we strongly recommend 
using Babel or similar solutions (e.g. TypeScript).
