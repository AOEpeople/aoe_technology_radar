[Axure](https://www.axure.com/) is a tool which enables the creation of flowcharts, wireframes, mockups, user journeys and more.
Through features like conditional logic, dynamic content and animations it is possible to create highly functional and rich UI prototypes which convey a realistic look and feel on how the application to be developed should behave and look.
 
We at AOE used Axure successfully in several projects and it helped us a lot
 - as discussion base with customers on how features should look, feel and work
 - as discussion base for customers with other stakeholders
 - as specification and discussion base for developers on how features should look and behave
 
In conclusion, Axure is a great tool to provide all stakeholders with a common understanding and helped us a lot to specify requirements and find their implications.
