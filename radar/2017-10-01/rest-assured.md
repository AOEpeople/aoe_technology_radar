**[REST-assured](https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured)** is a Java DSL for simplifying testing of REST-based services built on top of HTTP Builder. It supports the most important http request methods and can be used to validate and verify the response of these requests.

At AOE, we use REST-assured with Spock to automate our API testing. We appreciate the easy-to-use DSL, which uses the Given-When-Then template (also known as Gherkin language). This template helps other project members to understand the code/test easily.

Because of the seamless integration with Spock and our positive experience in one of our major projects, we classify REST-assured as *assess.*
