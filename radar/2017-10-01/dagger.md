[Dagger](https://google.github.io/dagger/) is a fully static, compile-time [dependency injection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) framework for both Java and Android. [Dagger](https://google.github.io/dagger/) doesn't use reflections at runtime, it saves resources. For us, it is a perfect match for Android development.

We at AOE use it as a base framework for every Android project.
