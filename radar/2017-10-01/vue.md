Vue is a progressive, incrementally adoptable framework for building user interfaces maintained by Evan You. Unlike [other monolithic frameworks](http://vuejs.org/v2/guide/comparison.html), the core library is focused on the view layer only and is very easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated single-page applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries such as [vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/) and [vue-router](http://router.vuejs.org/en/).

Vue uses an HTML-based template syntax that allows you to declaratively bind the rendered DOM to the underlying Vue instanceâ€™s data. Under the hood, Vue compiles the templates into Virtual DOM render functions. Combined with the [reactivity system](http://vuejs.org/v2/guide/reactivity.html) Vue is able to intelligently figure out the minimal amount of components to re-render and apply the minimal amount of DOM manipulations when the app state changes, which provides for very high performance.

Applications can be split into [Single File Components](http://vuejs.org/v2/guide/single-file-components.html) - a single file containing the template (HTML), style (CSS) and functionality (JS) - which simplifies maintainability and testability of the code and promotes reusability across other projects.
