With Spring Boot you create standalone Spring Applications with minimum configuration. [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) rapidly gets you up and running for production.

With an embedded Tomcat, Jetty and Undertow you have everything you need to deploy your application out-of-the-box.

The Spring Cloud ecosystem also gives you a lot of extension points for developing, deploying and running cloud applications.

It's based on the rock-solid Spring framework and provides excellent documentation.

At AOE, we use Spring Boot in a microservice architecture. Together with Groovy as the implementation Language, and some other Tools (Spring Security, Cloud, HATEOAS, Data, Session) from the Spring environment, we are able to create complex and powerful applications in no time.
