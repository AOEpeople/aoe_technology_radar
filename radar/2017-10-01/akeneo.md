Akeneo is a Product Information Management system (also known as PIM, PCM or Product MDM) and helps centralize and harmonize all the technical and marketing information of products.

We use Akeneo with success in our projects and products (For example in OM3), where it is responsible for:

-   Keeping product data separate from other applications - such as E-Commerce systems
-   Managing livecycles of products and managing product portfolios with their category structures
-   Managing attributes and families and therefore acting as attribute master for the suite

The system has a modern and friendly user interface and product managers find things such as completenesscheck, translation views and mass editing very helpful.

With delta export and import capabilities and the usage of Mongo DB as persitence backend, the performance is acceptable. We miss a richer API - but the system is extendable and based on PHP/Symfony 2.
