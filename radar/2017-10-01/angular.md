Beside that many major upgrades from version 2 to 5 which often needed manual hands on a lot has happened in the Angular 
ecosystem in 2017. Like in particular the improvements on the HTTP-Client which requires less coding effort from now or 
the great improvements on angular.cli like aot (ahead of time compile) for faster rendering, fewer requests and 
much smaller builds to name just the most important ones.

Beside that many facts about, we made many good experiences using Angular in large and medium size projects. Actually 
it's the choice in our telecommunication sector teams as single page application framework (SPA) for micro service front 
ends.

The convenient scaffolding of unit- and end-2-end-tests provides a very quality driven workflow.
Also the component architecture helps to keep the codebase understandable end maintainable.
