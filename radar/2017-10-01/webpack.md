In the last few years, Webpack has grown to become the de-facto standard for Web
bundling in the JavaScript-Ecosystem. With Version 3, Webpack is a more robust
and better documented bundler with nice new features such as
[scope hoisting](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/module-concatenation-plugin/).
Because of this, and because of the continuously growing community, we have adopted Webpack for nearly
every single-page application we have.
