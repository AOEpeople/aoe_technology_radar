In the last few years Webpack has grown to become the de facto standard for web
bundling in the JavaScript-Ecosystem. With Version 3 Webpack is a more robust
and better documented bundler with nice new features such as
[scope hoisting](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/module-concatenation-plugin/).
Therefore and the more and more growing community we adopted Webpack in nearly
every SinglePageApplication we got.
