Until now, we have been using [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) for almost every single task that we have automated. With [Gitlab CI](https://about.gitlab.com/features/gitlab-ci-cd/) on the market, we have a number of new possibilities.

Some of the highlights are:

* Multi-platform – you can execute builds on Unix, Windows, OSX, and any other platform that supports Go.
* Multi-language – build scripts are command-line driven and work with Java, PHP, Ruby, C and any other language.
* Pipeline – you can define multiple jobs per stage and you can trigger other builds.
* Autoscaling – you can automatically spin up and down VM's to make sure your builds get processed immediately and minimize costs.
* Build artifacts – you can upload binaries and other build artifacts to GitLab and browse and download them.
* Docker support – you can use custom Docker images, spin up services as part of testing, build new Docker images, even run on Kubernetes.
