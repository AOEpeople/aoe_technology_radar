[SVN/Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/) has been a
strong tool for version control for many years, but a stronger and better tool
([Git](https://git-scm.com/)) has taken over.

During the past few years, we have migrated more and more
repositories from SVN to Git; and we will completely turn off our SVN server by the end
of this year (2017).
