[SVN/Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/) have for many years been a strong tool for version control, but a stronger and better tool ([Git](https://git-scm.com/)) have talken over. 

We have over the last period of time, read years, migrate more and more repositories from SVN to Git, and we will completely turn off our SVN server end of this year (2017).
