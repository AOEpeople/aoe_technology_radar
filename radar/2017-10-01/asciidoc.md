AsciiDoc is a [lightweight markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language) like Markdown. 
With a concise Syntax it supports more features than Markdown without extension like Tables and Table of Contents.
It's easy to write complex documentation with AsciiDoc. And with Asciidoctor you can export you're text to Pdf, Html and so on.

At AOE we use AsciiDoc for Documentation in our Repositoies.
