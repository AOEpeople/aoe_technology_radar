AsciiDoc is a [lightweight markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language) such as Markdown. 
With a concise Syntax, it supports more features than Markdown without extensions such as Tables and Table of Contents.
It's easy to write complex documentation with AsciiDoc. And with Asciidoctor you can export your text to Pdf, HTML, etc.

At AOE, we use AsciiDoc for Documentation in our Repositories.
