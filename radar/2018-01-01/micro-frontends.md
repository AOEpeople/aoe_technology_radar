We see many benefits in Microservices – especially in large teams – but often this architecture 
does not involve the user interface. Instead, you might end up maintaining a frontend monolith. With Micro Frontends 
you enable your frontend developers to gain the same benefits that we have grown accustomed to in a Microservice architecture: 
Decoupled components, which are developed and deployed by independent teams. But what sounds reasonable comes with 
challenges. Integrating different Frontends on the client- or server-side can be tricky, as well as keeping the overall 
User Experience consistent.

Despite the challenges, Micro Frontends help us to develop large applications across multiple teams. Developers can
work more independently without having too much trouble maintaining a large codebase. Being able to update oder 
replace Frontend libraries in some parts of the application is yet another benefit in the fast-moving world of 
frontend development.
