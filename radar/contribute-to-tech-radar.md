# Contributing to the Tech Radar

We are always happy if people want to contribute to the tech radar!

Tech radar is a curated overview of the most important technologies that are currently relevant to the Haufe Group technology strategy and Haufe Group product development. The tech radar tends to focus on technology concepts like Blockchain or Machine Learning and not on specific technologies like JavaScript or No-SQL-databases. The reason for this is that the technology radar serves the purpose of informing everyone at Haufe Group about new technology that can enable their product - whether it be an internal or customer-facing.

It's a good idea to keep this in mind when you decide that you want to contribute to the tech radar because, really, the idea behind the radar blips is to help start conversations - among all job roles at Haufe Group - about how which technologies can be used to improve or create new products for Haufe Group.

The content for the tech radar is stored a GitHub repository and edited in Git Markdown format. To be able to contribute, you must know how \(or know someone\) to [make a pull request from a forked GitHub repository](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/). Contributions are reviewed through the Git contribution workflow.

It's also a good idea to follow these steps, when contributing information.

## Inform the tech Innovation cell

Since the tech radar is curated, the first step is to tell us what you wish to contribute. You can let us know in various ways

* E-mail to [\_kickstarter\_customer\_success\_new\_tech@haufe-lexware.com](mailto:_kickstarter_customer_success_new_tech@haufe-lexware.com?subject=Tech Radar Contribution).
* Rocket chat in the "Tech Radar" channel.
* Jabber to us in the Jabber "Tech Radar" channel
* Make an "content-less" pull request - **from your forked GitHub repository** - and say you wish to contribute to [https://github.com/Haufe-Lexware/aoe\_technology\_radar](https://github.com/Haufe-Lexware/aoe_technology_radar).

When we receive your request, we'll contact you to talk about it and to see if it's something the tech radar is ready for and how much content is needed for version 1.0.

## Contributing content

There are various ways to to contribute content. For folks, who don't want to contribute over Git, there are German and English Microsoft Word templates that you can use to structure your content. Just ask for them.

If you are going to contribute over Git, the recommended workflow is for you to [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/ "How to fork a Git repo") the [https://github.com/Haufe-Lexware/aoe\_technology\_radar](https://github.com/Haufe-Lexware/aoe_technology_radar) repository to your own Git account. Create and edit your content from your forked repository and make a pull request inside of the "PrepareContent" branch \(Select the "PrepareContent" branch in your fork\). Directly after you fork the Tech Radar, it is a good idea to change your default branch to "PrepareContent" from your repository settings.

Documentation for [forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/ "How to make a pull request") is linked. But, if you have any questions about forking a repository or creating a pull request, please contact us.

## Edit content

Once it is decided that content should be added to the tech radar, you can start contributing. It is good to look at [other tech radar content](http://hg-tr-prod.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com/techradar/infrastructure-and-operational-technology/blockchain.html "Blockchain in the Tech Radar"). Here you can get an idea of the scope and purpose of a tech radar article. tech radar content is created with [Git Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

There are several way to edit Git Markdown. People, who work with Git and Markdown on a regular basis should feel free to use an IDE to contribute and edit Tech Radar content. Remember if you are working with a Git repo you always want to work from the "PrepareContent" branch and never from "master" branch!

Using Git from the Git Bash is not described here. If you want to use bash commands to manage your content with Git, we assume you know how to do it already.
