It provides a reliable and scalable way to transport data between loosely coupled applications, using different EAI patterns such as the Publish &amp; Subscriber pattern. AMQP supports direct and fan-out exchanges (broadcasts) as well as topics. Queuing mechanisms allow for robust architectures, mitigating the risks of application downtimes. Typically, a RabbitMQ server can easily buffer millions of messages. RabbitMQ supports JMS in addition to AMQP. It is not intended to use JMS for new systems, but it makes RabbitMQ useful for integrating legacy systems.</p>\n<p>There are several alternative solutions to RabbitMQ, e. g. the free Apache ActiveMQ, which is integrated in <a href=\"/techradar/tools/anypoint-platform.html\">Anypoint platform</a>. ActiveMQ implements a somewhat simpler routing concept than RabbitMQ, but offers more protocols. Commercial products in this area are offered by IBM (Websphere MQ), Fiorano and almost every vendor of ESB products.</p>\n<p>We use RabbitMQ internally for transferring messages safely in our logging ecosystem between <a href=\"/techradar/platforms-and-aoe-services/elk-stack.html\">Logstash</a> proxies and servers using direct and fan-out exchanges for delivering messages to appropriate destinations. RabbitMQ is also used to asynchronously trigger Jenkins jobs from our SCMs to mitigate heavy load on the SCMs, usually caused by Jenkins polls for SCM changes. Additionally, some critical events for monitoring are using RabbitMQ for guaranteed notification. </p>\n<p>RabbitMQ is rated &quot;Trial&quot;. It fits into our approach to build robust, <a href=\"/techradar/methods-and-patterns/resilience-thinking.html\">resilient systems</a> and use <a href=\"/techradar/methods-and-patterns/decoupling-infrastructure-via-messaging.html\">asyncronous messages</a> for loosely coupled communications between components. In practice, RabbitMQ proved to be stable and dealt well with service interruptions from failures and maintenance slots. A common pain point is RabbitMQ as a single point of failure disrupting the data flow in a system. This issue is currently approached by setting up a HA cluster for RabbitMQ. The outcome of this approach will clarify the extent of future usage of RabbitMQ in our systems.</p>\n<p> <img src=\"/techradar/assets/images/rabbitmq.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n"}],"name":"rabbitmq","title":"RabbitMQ","ring":"adopt","quadrant":"tools","body":"<p>RabbitMQ has proven to work very well for messaging in our projects, thats why we updated it to &quot;adopt&quot;. </p>\n","info":"","release":"2019-11-01","fileName":"/Users/bastian.ike/develop/techradar/aoe/radar/2019-11-01/rabbitmq.md"},{"flag":"changed","featured":true,"revisions":[{"name":"raml","release":"2019-11-01","title":"RAML","ring":"hold","quadrant":"languages-and-frameworks","fileName":"/Users/bastian.ike/develop/techradar/aoe/radar/2019-11-01/raml.md","body":"<p>Since the RAML project has decided to <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://blogs.mulesoft.com/dev/api-dev/open-api-raml-better-together/\">join</a> the OpenAPI initiative and the RAML ecosystem lacks further development and additional tools, we decided to  use and recommend using <a href=\"/techradar/tools/open-api.html\">&quot;OpenAPI specififcation (OAS)&quot;</a> as description standard instead.</p>\n<p>RAML still provides advantages in modeling an API through it&#39;s more expressive modeling language and can produce OAS</p>\n"},{"name":"raml","release":"2017-03-01","title":"RAML","ring":"adopt","quadrant":"tools","fileName":"/Users/bastian.ike/develop/techradar/aoe/radar/2017-03-01/raml.md","body":"<p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://raml.org/\">RAML</a> (the RESTful API Modelling Language) is a YAML-based API specification language.

Unlike Domain Driven Design, which focuses on the tactical design in an application, strategic domain driven design is an approach that is very helpful for the high-level strategic design of an application and distributed software architecture.</p>\n<p>It is a pattern familiy focused on using and defining Bounded Context and thinking explicitly of the different relationship patterns and the required &quot;translation&quot; of similar &quot;concepts&quot; between the bounded contexts. It is helpful to argue and find a good strategic architecture in alignment with the requirements, the domain and by considering Conway&#39;s Law.\nA context map and a common conceptional core help to understand and improve the overall strategic picture. Especially with the <a href=\"/techradar/methods-and-patterns/microservices.html\">Microservice</a> approach, it is important to define and connect services following the low coupling - high cohesion principles by idendifying fitting bounded contexts.</p>\n<p>The following chart gives an overview of possible relationships between bounded contexts:\n<img src=\"/techradar/assets/images/strategic-domain-driven-design-relationships.png\" alt=\"strategic-domain-driven-design-relationships\"></p>\n<p>While we have found that this approach is especially useful in designing distributed systems and applications with <a href=\"/techradar/methods-and-patterns/microservices.html\">microservices</a>, we have also extended this approach to provide guidlines for general enterprise architectures.</p>\n","info":"","release":"2017-03-01","fileName":"/Users/bastian.ike/develop/techradar/aoe/radar/2017-03-01/strategic-domain-driven-design.md"},{"flag":"new","featured":true,"revisions":[{"name":"stride-threat-modeling","release":"2019-11-01","title":"STRIDE Threat Modeling","ring":"trial","quadrant":"methods-and-patterns","fileName":"/Users/bastian.ike/develop/techradar/aoe/radar/2019-11-01/stride-threat-modeling.md","body":"<p>STRIDE is a model of threat groups that helps to identify security threats to any application, component or infrastructure.</p>\n<p>The acronym stands for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spoofing</li>\n<li>Tampering</li>\n<li>Repudiation</li>\n<li>Information disclosure</li>\n<li>Denial of service</li>\n<li>Elevation of privilege</li>\n</ul>\n<p>AOE is applying the threat model in collaborative sessions using the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/285.elevation-of-privilege-the-game.aspx\">Elevation of Privilege Card Game</a> which helps to spark imagination and makes threats more tangible. </p>\n"}],"name":"stride-threat-modeling","title":"STRIDE Threat Modeling","ring":"trial","quadrant":"methods-and-patterns","body":"<p>STRIDE is a model of threat groups that helps to identify security threats to any application, component or infrastructure.</p>\n<p>The acronym stands for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spoofing</li>\n<li>Tampering</li>\n<li>Repudiation</li>\n<li>Information disclosure</li>\n<li>Denial of service</li>\n<li>Elevation of privilege</li>\n</ul>\n<p>AOE is applying the threat model in collaborative sessions using the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/285.elevation-of-privilege-the-game.aspx\">Elevation of Privilege Card Game</a> which helps to spark imagination and makes threats more tangible. </p>\n","info":"","release":"2019-11-01","fileName":"/Users/bastian.ike/develop/techradar/aoe/radar/2019-11-01/stride-threat-modeling.md"},{"flag":"default","featured":false,"revisions":[{"name":"styleguide-driven-development","release":"2018-03-01","title":"Styleguide Driven Development","ring":"adopt","quadrant":"methods-and-patterns","fileName":"/Users/bastian.ike/develop/techradar/aoe/radar/2018-03-01/styleguide-driven-development.md","body":"<p>Updated to &quot;adopt&quot;.</p>\n"},{"name":"styleguide-driven-development","release":"2017-03-01","title":"Styleguide Driven Development","ring":"trial","quadrant":"methods-and-patterns","fileName":"/Users/bastian.ike/develop/techradar/aoe/radar/2017-03-01/styleguide-driven-development.md","body":"<p>The goal of Styleguide Driven Development is to develop your application user Interface independently and reusable in a Pattern Library.\\\nIn the old days, the frontend was developed based on page-centric Photoshop files which made it hard to change things afterwards.
