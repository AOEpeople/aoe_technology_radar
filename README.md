## Looking for the AOE Tech Radar content?

- The repository is now found here: https://github.com/AOEpeople/techradar
- The AOE Tech radar is deployed here: https://www.aoe.com/techradar/index.html

## ✨ Version 4.0.0

Version 4.0.0 is a complete rewrite of the AOE Technology Radar. It is now based
on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to provide enhanced static site generation. The visualization has
been rewritten without the need for the D3 dependency. New features include a fuzzy search based on
Fuse.js, non-overlapping blips on the radar, and a reworked tag filter on the homepage.

To migrate from the old version please migrate your `package.json`'s scripts and create a
new `config.json` based on the documentation below. You can find a reference implementation in
our [repo](https://github.com/AOEpeople/techradar). The old version is still available in the `v3`
branch.

Version 4.0.0 also removes the .html extension from the URLs. If you want to support the old URLs,
we recommend to add a redirect rule. For nginx, you can use the following rule:

```nginx
rewrite ^/techradar/(.+)\.html$ /techradar/$1/ permanent;
```

## Create your own radar

The generator is free to use under Open Source License - in fact there are already some other Radars
published based on our Radar and there are also Contributions back. However, it would be nice to
mention in radar that the generator is based on this repository.

### Step 1: Create a new project

Ensure node.js ist installed and create a new project by creating a new folder with a `package.json`
file like the following and adapt to your needs:

```json
{
  "name": "aoe-techradar",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "license": "MIT",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "techradar build",
    "serve": "techradar serve"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "aoe_technology_radar": "^4"
  }
}
```

Run `npm install` to install the dependencies and run `npm run build` to create the initial radar.
This will also create a basic bootstrap of all required files, including the `config.json` and
the `about.md` if they do not exist yet.

### Step 2: Change logo and the favicon

Place your `logo.svg` and `favicon.ico` in the `public` folder next to the `package.json`.
The ideal logo is 150px x 60px. For reference have a look at [public/logo.svg](./public/logo.svg).

If you want to use a file other than an SVG, copy it to the `public` folder and set the name of the
file as `logoFile` inside the `config.json`. e.g. `"logoFile": "acme-logo.png"`

### Step 3: Configure the radar

Open the `config.json` file and configure the radar to your needs.

### Step 4: Add a help page with explanations

Edit the `about.md` file next to the `package.json` file. The contents will be shown on
the `/help-and-about-tech-radar` page. Optionally you can change the title of the menu by
setting `labels.pageAbout` in your `config.json`.

### Step 5: Create the radar items

Remove or edit existing items in the `radar` folder.
For a new release, create a folder of the release date (YYYY-MM-DD)
under `./radar`. e.g. `./radar/2024-03-01`.

The items are written in Markdown format (.md)

Each file has a meta header where the attributes of the item are listed:

```
---
title: "React"
ring: adopt
quadrant: languages-and-frameworks
tags: [frontend, coding]
---

Text goes here. You can use **markdown** here.
```

Following front-matter attributes are possible:

- **title**: Name of the Item
- **quadrant**: Quadrant. One of the configured quadrants in `config.quadrants`
- **ring**: Ring section in radar. One of the configured rings in `config.rings`
- **tags**: Optional tags for filtering.
- **featured**: (optional, default "true") If you set this to `false`, the item
  will not be visible in the radar quadrants but still be available in the overview.

The name of the .md file acts as item identifier and may overwrite items with
the same name from older releases.

If an item is overwritten in a new release, the attributes from the new item are
merged with the old ones, and a new history entry is created for that item.

You can integrate images in your markdown. Put the image files in the `public/images` folder and
reference them

```
![nice image](/images/optional-content-image.png)
```

### Step 6: Build your radar

Your final file and folder structure should look like this:

```
├── about.md
├── config.json
├── package.json
├── public/
│ ├── images/
│ │ └── optional-content-image.png
│ ├── favicon.ico
│ └── logo.svg
└── radar/
  ├── 2023-12-31/
  │ ├── demo-item-1.md
  │ └── demo-item-2.md
  └── 2024-03-05/
    ├── demo-item-1.md
    └── demo-item-3.md
```

Run `npm run build` to build the radar and upload the files of the `./build` folder to your server.

You can view a development version of the radar by running `npm run serve` and open the radar in
your browser at `http://localhost:3000/techradar` or the path you specified via `basePath`.

## Advanced styling with `custom.css`

If you need to customize the radar's styles, you can add custom CSS rules to the `custom.css` file.

Be aware that this might break with future versions of the radar as we use css-modules in the
components which generates dynamic, hashed class names and the layout structure might change.

Therefore, it's advised the `[attribute^=value]` selector that matches elements whose attribute
value begins
with a specified value. As an example, if you want to always show the subline in the header use
the following rule:

```css
[class^="Logo_subline"] {
  display: block;
  opacity: 1;
}
```

If you want to include assets like images or fonts, use `../../public/` as the base path.
Adding a background image to the page could be archived like this:

```css
body {
  background: url("../../public/background.png");
}
```

Changing the font-family of the headlines:

```css
h1,
h2,
h3 {
  font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, Baskerville, Georgia, serif;
}
```

Changes to the css file will not be reflected in the development server. You need to
run `npm run serve` or `npm run build` to see the changes.

## Development

If you want to change core functionality of the radar, you can clone this repository and put your
radar's markdown-files, config.json and about.md in the `data` folder. Run `npm run build:data` to
parse the markdown files and create a `data.json` and then run `npm run dev` to start the
development server, which will be available at `http://localhost:3000/techradar` or the path
you specified via `basePath`.
